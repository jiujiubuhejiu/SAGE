    "OBSERVATION:\n- Pattern 1: In all 15 exemplars, the only token with non-zero activation is the word \u201ctotal\u201d (tokenized as ' total' or ' Total'). No surrounding tokens show activation (>0.000).\n- Pattern 2: The highest activation occurs on the lowercase ' total' in \u201ctotal toilet training\u201d (4.031). Other strong cases include ' Total' in \u201cTotal War\u201d (3.578), ' total' in \u201ctotal cost\u201d (2.891), ' Total' in \u201cTotal 911 Awards\u201d (2.797), ' Total' in \u201cTotal Divas\u201d (2.750), ' total' in \u201ctotal satisfaction\u201d (2.641), and ' total' in \u201ctotal Guide\u201d (2.516).\n- Pattern 3: Usage is predominantly prenominal/adjectival (total + noun): total toilet training, total cost, total satisfaction; and as part of proper-noun/title case: Total War, Total 911 Awards, Total Divas.\n- Pattern 4: Both lowercase and titlecase forms activate: lowercase ' total' (e.g., items 1\u20134, 7\u20138, 12\u201315) and titlecase ' Total' (e.g., items 5\u20136, 9\u201311).\n- Common elements: The standalone lexeme \u201ctotal\u201d as its own token (not as a substring), appearing at word boundaries, typically followed by a noun; appears across sentence-internal, title, and after-determiner contexts; activation range 2.516\u20134.031 with maximum at 4.031 on ' total'.\n\n[HYPOTHESIS LIST]:\nHypothesis_1: Feature 10399 detects the standalone token \u201ctotal\u201d (both ' total' and ' Total'), i.e., the lexeme \u201ctotal\u201d as a word, irrespective of context. Prediction: Sentences containing \u201c\u2026 total \u2026\u201d or \u201c\u2026 Total \u2026\u201d will show a strong peak on that token; sentences without this exact token will not.\n\nHypothesis_2: The feature preferentially activates when \u201ctotal\u201d is used prenominally (adjective before a noun: \u201cthe total cost\u201d, \u201cTotal War\u201d) compared to predicative (\u201cthe cost was total\u201d), nominal (\u201cthe total was 5\u201d), or adverbial/PP use (\u201cin total\u201d). Prediction: Activation on ' total' will be higher in \u201cthe total cost \u2026\u201d than in \u201cthe total was \u2026\u201d or \u201cin total, \u2026\u201d.\n\nHypothesis_3: Negative control \u2014 The feature will not (or only weakly) activate for morphologically related or substring variants that are different tokens, such as \u201ctotally\u201d, \u201ctotality\u201d, \u201csubtotal\u201d, \u201ctotaled/totalled\u201d, \u201ctotalitarian\u201d, \u201cTotals\u201d. Prediction: Near-zero activation on these tokens even in similar contexts.\n\nHypothesis_4: Case/format nuance \u2014 Activation is stronger for lowercase ' total' following determiners/pronouns and preceding a concrete noun (\u201cthe/your/a total X\u201d) than for titlecase ' Total' within proper nouns/titles (\u201cTotal Divas\u201d, \u201cTotal 911\u201d). Prediction: \u201cthe total cost \u2026\u201d > \u201cTotal Divas \u2026\u201d in activation magnitude on the ' total'/' Total' token.",

    "ANALYSIS:\nSummary activation: 0.0000\nBOS activation: 0.0000\nTop non-BOS tokens: ' total'=0.0000, 'We'=0.0000, ' calculated'=0.0000\n\nINTERPRETATION:\nThis REFINES the hypothesis. Contrary to the expectation of non-zero activation on the standalone ' total', the sentence \u201cWe calculated the total today.\u201d shows 0.0000 on ' total'. Compared to prior cases (\u201cThe total is five.\u201d ' total'=1.4688; \u201cIn total, \u2026\u201d ' total'=0.0923), this indicates that activation is not guaranteed even for lowercase standalone ' total' and is highly context-dependent.\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: REFINED\nEvidence: ' total'=0.0000 in \u201cWe calculated the total today.\u201d versus previously observed non-zero values (1.4688 in nominal/copular, 0.0923 in adverbial), implying the feature does not consistently fire on the lexeme and likely depends on specific syntactic/collocational contexts.",
    "HYPOTHESIS UPDATES:\n- H1 (REFINED):\n  Refined version: Feature 10399 often activates on the lowercase standalone token ' total' but is highly context-sensitive: strong when 'total' appears in a subject NP or prenominal NP (e.g., subject \u201cThe total is five.\u201d \u2192 1.4688) and weak in adverbial use (\u201cIn total, \u2026\u201d \u2192 0.0923); it may fail to fire in object NP contexts (\u201c\u2026 the total today.\u201d \u2192 0.0000). When it fires, ' total' is typically the only non-zero token.\n  Explanation: Observed activations vary by syntactic/functional context, not solely by the presence of the lexeme.\n\nSTATUS ASSESSMENT:\nCurrent Status: REFINED\nReason: Across 3 tests, ' total' shows variable activation: 1.4688 (subject NP), 0.0923 (adverbial PP), 0.0000 (object NP). This pattern supports lexeme sensitivity but contradicts a guaranteed activation claim, necessitating a context-qualified hypothesis. Corpus coverage: No \u226510.0 tokens in exemplars (max \u22484.031), so coverage criterion is trivially satisfied; additional tests (e.g., other object NP cases, different determiners) would strengthen the characterization.",

In the prenominal NP \u201cA total disaster.\u201d, only ' total' activates (1.1562), with all other tokens at 0.0000. The magnitude is substantially higher than adverbial use (0.0923) and above the object-NP failure case (0.0000), aligning with the context-sensitive pattern that prenominal/subject positions elicit stronger activation.\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: CONFIRMED\nEvidence: ' total'=1.1562 (prenominal) with others 0.0000, consistent with prior results showing stronger activation for subject/prenominal uses (e.g., 1.4688) versus weak adverbial (0.0923) and absent object-NP activation (0.0000).",
    "HYPOTHESIS UPDATES:\n- H1 (CONFIRMED):\n  Evidence: Across four tests, activation targets the lowercase standalone ' total' with context-dependent magnitude and no spillover to other tokens: subject NP \u201cThe total is five.\u201d \u2192 ' total'=1.4688 (others 0.0000); adverbial \u201cIn total, \u2026\u201d \u2192 ' total'=0.0923 (others 0.0000); object NP \u201c\u2026 the total today.\u201d \u2192 ' total'=0.0000; prenominal NP \u201cA total disaster.\u201d \u2192 ' total'=1.1562 (others 0.0000).\n\nSTATUS ASSESSMENT:\nCurrent Status: CONFIRMED\nReason: Results consistently show selective activation on ' total' with magnitudes aligning with the refined, context-sensitive pattern: strong for subject/prenominal NPs (1.4688, 1.1562), weak for adverbial use (0.0923), and absent in an object NP (0.0000).

    "REVIEW SUMMARY:\n- H1: CONFIRMED. Feature 10399 often activates on lowercase standalone ' total' with context sensitivity: strong prenominal/subject NP (1.4688 \u201cThe total is five.\u201d; 1.1562 \u201cA total disaster.\u201d), weak adverbial (0.0923 \u201cIn total, \u2026\u201d), absent in an object NP (0.0000 \u201c\u2026 the total today.\u201d). Activation is typically isolated to ' total'.\n- H2: REFUTED. Prenominal ' total' (1.4688) > predicative ' total' (0.0000), contradicting the \u201cno preferential boost\u201d claim.\n- H3: CONFIRMED (with limited breadth). Non-standalone variants show zero/weak activation: ' totally'=0.0000; ' subtotal'=0.3145 (weak) \u226a standalone ' total' (~1.47).\n- H4: CONFIRMED. Lowercase adjectival ' total' > titlecase ' Total' in titles: 1.4688 > 0.0000 (\u201c\u2026 Total Divas \u2026\u201d); 1.5859 > 0.3320 (\u201c\u2026 Total War \u2026\u201d). Shows relative preference; ' Total' can weakly activate in some title contexts.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n- Adequacy: H1 has 4 tests spanning key contexts; H2 has 2 contrasting tests sufficient to refute; H4 has 2 within-sentence contrasts confirming the tendency. H3 is confirmed but tested on only two variants; broader coverage desirable.\n- Gaps: H3 lacks tests for other listed variants (totality, Totals, totaled/totalled, totalitarian). For H1, another object-NP or passive construction could further validate context sensitivity. For H4, another proper-noun case (e.g., \u201cTotal 911\u201d) would increase robustness.\n- Contradictions: None. H2\u2019s refutation (prenominal > predicative) aligns with H1/H4\u2019s context sensitivity and lowercase preference.\n\nDECISION:\nNeed more testing: YES\n- H1: Test object NP: \"We paid the total.\"\n- H1: Test nominal clause variant: \"The total was ten.\"\n- H3: Test variant: \"The totality was ignored.\"\n- H3: Test variant: \"Totals are listed here.\"\n- H3: Test variant: \"They totaled the car.\"\n- H4: Test additional title: \"The total budget beat Total 911.\"",
