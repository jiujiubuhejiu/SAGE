    "content": "OBSERVATION:\n- Pattern 1: In all 15 exemplars, the only token with non-zero activation is the word “total” (tokenized as ' total' or ' Total'). No surrounding tokens show activation (>0.000).\n- Pattern 2: The highest activation occurs on the lowercase ' total' in “total toilet training” (4.031). Other strong cases include ' Total' in “Total War” (3.578), ' total' in “total cost” (2.891), ' Total' in “Total 911 Awards” (2.797), ' Total' in “Total Divas” (2.750), ' total' in “total satisfaction” (2.641), and ' total' in “total Guide” (2.516).\n- Pattern 3: Usage is predominantly prenominal/adjectival (total + noun): total toilet training, total cost, total satisfaction; and as part of proper-noun/title case: Total War, Total 911 Awards, Total Divas.\n- Pattern 4: Both lowercase and titlecase forms activate: lowercase ' total' (e.g., items 1–4, 7–8, 12–15) and titlecase ' Total' (e.g., items 5–6, 9–11).\n- Common elements: The standalone lexeme “total” as its own token (not as a substring), appearing at word boundaries, typically followed by a noun; appears across sentence-internal, title, and after-determiner contexts; activation range 2.516–4.031 with maximum at 4.031 on ' total'.\n\n[HYPOTHESIS LIST]:\nHypothesis_1: Feature 10399 detects the standalone token “total” (both ' total' and ' Total'), i.e., the lexeme “total” as a word, irrespective of context. Prediction: Sentences containing “… total …” or “… Total …” will show a strong peak on that token; sentences without this exact token will not.\n\nHypothesis_2: The feature preferentially activates when “total” is used prenominally (adjective before a noun: “the total cost”, “Total War”) compared to predicative (“the cost was total”), nominal (“the total was 5”), or adverbial/PP use (“in total”). Prediction: Activation on ' total' will be higher in “the total cost …” than in “the total was …” or “in total, …”.\n\nHypothesis_3: Negative control — The feature will not (or only weakly) activate for morphologically related or substring variants that are different tokens, such as “totally”, “totality”, “subtotal”, “totaled/totalled”, “totalitarian”, “Totals”. Prediction: Near-zero activation on these tokens even in similar contexts.\n\nHypothesis_4: Case/format nuance — Activation is stronger for lowercase ' total' following determiners/pronouns and preceding a concrete noun (“the/your/a total X”) than for titlecase ' Total' within proper nouns/titles (“Total Divas”, “Total 911”). Prediction: “the total cost …” > “Total Divas …” in activation magnitude on the ' total'/' Total' token."

Identify ALL tokens with activation ≥10.0 from corpus exemplars (Round 2)\n2. Verify each token was tested in at least ONE synthetic test prompt\n3. If ALL tested → \"Can conclude: YES\"; If ANY untested → \"Can conclude: NO\" (list untested tokens)\n4. Exception: Round ≥15 → Can conclude despite gaps\n\n**Conclusion Assessment**:\n1. Can we draw conclusions now? (YES/NO)\n2. Do we have sufficient evidence? (≥3 tests, ≥10 rounds OR confirmed pattern)\n3. Corpus coverage: Have all high-activation tokens (≥10.0) been tested?\n4. Are there critical tests missing? (Be specific if NO)\n\n**Rules**:\n- Do NOT issue [TOOL] commands\n- **MANDATORY**: After 2+ test results, UNCHANGED is FORBIDDEN\n- **MANDATORY**: Prefer CONFIRMED/REFUTED when evidence is strong; Use REFINED when evidence is weak/ambiguous\n- **MANDATORY**: Check corpus coverage before concluding\n- Be honest about evidence sufficiency; don't wait for \"perfect\" consistency\n"

Corpus coverage check: no ≥10.0 tokens in exemplars (max ≈4.031), but we cannot conclude definitively yet (only 1 targeted test). Critical missing tests: additional proper-noun cases (“Total 911 Awards”, “Total War”) and more lowercase adjectival cases (“your total satisfaction”, “a total loss”), plus capitalized 'Total' at sentence start without being a title."

    "content": "REVIEW SUMMARY:\n- H1: CONFIRMED. Feature 10399 often activates on lowercase standalone ' total' with context sensitivity: strong prenominal/subject NP (1.4688 “The total is five.”; 1.1562 “A total disaster.”), weak adverbial (0.0923 “In total, …”), absent in an object NP (0.0000 “… the total today.”). Activation is typically isolated to ' total'.\n- H2: REFUTED. Prenominal ' total' (1.4688) > predicative ' total' (0.0000), contradicting the “no preferential boost” claim.\n- H3: CONFIRMED (with limited breadth). Non-standalone variants show zero/weak activation: ' totally'=0.0000; ' subtotal'=0.3145 (weak) ≪ standalone ' total' (~1.47).\n- H4: CONFIRMED. Lowercase adjectival ' total' > titlecase ' Total' in titles: 1.4688 > 0.0000 (“… Total Divas …”); 1.5859 > 0.3320 (“… Total War …”). Shows relative preference; ' Total' can weakly activate in some title contexts.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n- Adequacy: H1 has 4 tests spanning key contexts; H2 has 2 contrasting tests sufficient to refute; H4 has 2 within-sentence contrasts confirming the tendency. H3 is confirmed but tested on only two variants; broader coverage desirable.\n- Gaps: H3 lacks tests for other listed variants (totality, Totals, totaled/totalled, totalitarian). For H1, another object-NP or passive construction could further validate context sensitivity. For H4, another proper-noun case (e.g., “Total 911”) would increase robustness.\n- Contradictions: None. H2’s refutation (prenominal > predicative) aligns with H1/H4’s context sensitivity and lowercase preference.\n\nDECISION:\nNeed more testing: YES\n- H1: Test object NP: \"We paid the total.\"\n- H1: Test nominal clause variant: \"The total was ten.\"\n- H3: Test variant: \"The totality was ignored.\"\n- H3: Test variant: \"Totals are listed here.\"\n- H3: Test variant: \"They totaled the car.\"\n- H4: Test additional title: \"The total budget beat Total 911.\""

Prediction: Activation on ' total' will be higher in “the total cost …” than in “the total was …” or “in total, …”.\n  Current Text: Feature 10399 does not show a preferentially higher activation for prenominal “total”; observed activation on ' total' is modest (~1.47) and comparable to non-prenominal uses.\n  Explanation: In “The total cost was high.” (prenominal), ' total' activated at 1.4688, not higher than a nominal-use baseline (1.4688), failing the “preferentially higher” prediction.\n  Status: REFUTED\n  Tests: 2 tests\n  Test History:\n    1.

Prediction: Near-zero activation on these tokens even in similar contexts.\n  Current Text: Feature 10399 does not activate on the morphological variant “totally”; evidence supports insensitivity to at least some non-standalone variants, but other variants (e.g., “totality”, “subtotal”, “Totals”) remain untested.\n  Explanation: In “He totally forgot.”, all tokens, including ' totally', had 0.0000 activation.\n  Status: CONFIRMED\n  Tests: 5 tests\n  Test History:\n    1.

Activation patterns are consistent and sufficient for final conclusions without additional tests."

When it fires, ' total' is typically the only non-zero token.\n  Explanation: Observed activations vary by syntactic/functional context, not\n❌ H2: Feature 10399 does not show a preferentially higher activation for prenominal “total”; observed activation on ' total' is modest (~1.47) and comparable to non-prenominal uses.\n  Explanation: In “The total cost was high.” (prenominal), ' total' activated at 1.4688, not higher than a nominal-use baseline (1.4688), failing the “preferentially higher” prediction.\n✅ H3: Feature 10399 does not activate on the morphological variant “totally”; evidence supports insensitivity to at least some non-standalone variants, but other variants (e.g., “totality”, “subtotal”, “Totals”) remain untested.\n  Explanation: In “He totally forgot.”, all tokens, including ' totally', had 0.0000 activation.\n✅ H4: Feature 10399 tends to activate more for lowercase ' total' used adjectivally after a determiner and before a concrete noun than for titlecase ' Total' inside proper nouns/titles; however, ' Total' can activate in some title contexts, so the effect is relative/tendential rather than absolute.\n  Explanation: In “The total cost exceeded the Total Divas budget.”, ' total'=1.4688 while ' Total'=0.0000, showing a within-sentence preference for lowercase adjectival use.\n\n\n**Required Output Format**:\n```\n[DESCRIPTION]: \n[2-3 sentences describing what this feature detects. \nMust be specific and complete.
