    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "OBSERVATION:\n- Pattern 1: The maximally activating token is consistently the noun “result(s)”. In all 15 exemplars, only the token “ result” or “ results” carries high activation (others in the ±5-token buffer are ~0.000). Peak examples: “ results” at 3.906 (Ex. 1–2), 3.672 (Ex. 3–4); “ result” at 2.734 (Ex. 5–6), 2.688 (Ex. 7–8).\n- Pattern 2: Plural > singular activation. “results” dominates 11/15 exemplars with activations 2.500–3.906; “result” occurs in 4/15 with activations 2.688–2.734. The top plural (3.906) notably exceeds the top singular (2.734) by ~1.17.\n- Pattern 3: Strong co-occurrence with “production/return” verbs immediately to the left: “produce/produced” (Ex. 1–2, 9), “yielded/yielded no” (Ex. 3–4, 10–13), “return” (Ex. 14–15), “gave/getting” (Ex. 5, 7–8). Despite this, only the noun “result(s)” token spikes.\n- Pattern 4: Frequent quality/quantity modifiers adjacent to “result(s)”: “different” (Ex. 3–4, 14–15), “disappointing” (Ex. 9), “no” (Ex. 10–11), “inconsistent/inconclusive” (Ex. 12–13), “good/right” (Ex. 5, 7–8). These do not themselves activate.\n- Common elements: noun “result(s)” denoting outcomes; appears as object/complement of verbs like yield/produce/return/give/get; often modified by evaluative/quantifier adjectives; cross-domain usage (science, computing/search, business aphorism); activation localized strictly to the “result(s)” token.\n\n[HYPOTHESIS LIST]:\nHypothesis_1: The feature encodes the lexical concept of the plural noun “results” (outcomes) and will strongly activate on the token “results” across domains. Prediction: Sentences with “… results …” (e.g., “experimental results”, “search results”, “produce results”) will elicit high activation on the “results” token, typically >2.5 and potentially ~3.5–3.9 based on exemplars (max 3.906 observed).\n\nHypothesis_2: The feature also responds to the singular noun “result” but more weakly than the plural. Prediction: Minimal pairs (“This produced results.” vs “This produced a result.”) will show higher activation on “results” than on “result” by ~0.7–1.2 on average (exemplar top: 3.906 vs 2.734).\n\nHypothesis_3: Negative control — The feature is selective for the noun sense and will not strongly activate for the verb “result” (“may result in …”) or the idiom “as a result”. Prediction: In “This may result in delays.” and “As a result, …”, activation on “result” will be low (<0.5), substantially below noun-usage cases.\n\nHypothesis_4: Production/measurement context boosts activation relative to neutral contexts. Prediction: When “results” is the direct object of verbs like “yield/produce/return/give/get” (e.g., “yielded no results”, “return different results”), activation will be higher than in copular or static contexts (e.g., “The results are posted.” or “These are the results.”). Expect measurable elevation (e.g., “produce/return/yield + results” > “results are …”).\n\nHypothesis_5: The feature is wordform-specific and will not strongly activate for near-synonyms lacking the “result(s)” string (e.g., “outcomes”, “findings”). Prediction: “The outcomes were inconclusive.” and “The findings were inconclusive.” will show low activation on those tokens, far below “The results were inconclusive.”"

The feature strongly activates on the singular noun: ' result'=3.0938. However, compared to the plural test in a similar frame (“The search returned no results.” → ' results'=2.7031), the singular here is higher, contradicting the “weaker than plural” prediction. This suggests context (e.g., negation “no” vs determiner “a”) can modulate magnitude more than number.\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: REFINED\nEvidence: Strong activation on singular (' result'=3.0938) shows responsiveness, but it is not reliably weaker than plural (plural in similar prompt was 2.7031). Refined: The feature responds strongly to both “result” and “results”; relative strength depends on context (e.g., negation) rather than strictly on plurality."

H1 has ample tests (8) showing clear context dependence rather than uniform activation; it should be refined rather than further tested.\n- Gaps: None critical; H1’s claim should be narrowed to production/return/yield object contexts.\n- Contradictions: None between hypotheses; H1’s broad “across domains” claim conflicts with observed zeros but aligns with H4’s context-boost pattern.\n\nDECISION:\nNeed more testing: NO\nCurrent evidence is sufficient: We have multiple positives and negatives delineating the feature’s selectivity—strong activation on “result(s)” in production/return/yield object contexts; zero for verb/idiom uses and near-synonyms; zero in neutral/subject/copular frames. This supports refining H1 and confirms H2–H5 without additional tests."

Prediction: Sentences with “… results …” (e.g., “experimental results”, “search results”, “produce results”) will elicit high activation on the “results” token, typically >2.5 and potentially ~3.5–3.9 based on exemplars (max 3.906 observed).\n✅ H2: The feature responds strongly to the noun “result” as well as “results”; activation magnitude is context-dependent (e.g., determiners/negation), and plurality alone does not guarantee higher activation for “results”.\n  Explanation: In a comparable “search returned X” frame, singular ' result'=3.0938 exceeded plural ' results'=2.7031, contradicting the predicted weaker singular and indicating context modulation.\n✅ H3: Negative control — The feature is selective for the noun sense and will not strongly activate for the verb “result” (“may result in …”) or the idiom “as a result”.

Expect measurable elevation (e.g., “produce/return/yield + results” > “results are …”).\n✅ H5: The feature is wordform-specific and will not strongly activate for near-synonyms lacking the “result(s)” string (e.g., “outcomes”, “findings”). Prediction: “The outcomes were inconclusive.” and “The findings were inconclusive.” will show low activation on those tokens, far below “The results were inconclusive.”\n\n\n**Required Output Format**:\n```\n[DESCRIPTION]: \n[2-3 sentences describing what this feature detects. \nMust be specific and complete.
