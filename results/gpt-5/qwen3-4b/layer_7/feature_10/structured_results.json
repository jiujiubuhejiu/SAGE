    "OBSERVATION:\n- Pattern 1: The maximally activating token is consistently the noun \u201cresult(s)\u201d. In all 15 exemplars, only the token \u201c result\u201d or \u201c results\u201d carries high activation (others in the \u00b15-token buffer are ~0.000). Peak examples: \u201c results\u201d at 3.906 (Ex. 1\u20132), 3.672 (Ex. 3\u20134); \u201c result\u201d at 2.734 (Ex. 5\u20136), 2.688 (Ex. 7\u20138).\n- Pattern 2: Plural > singular activation. \u201cresults\u201d dominates 11/15 exemplars with activations 2.500\u20133.906; \u201cresult\u201d occurs in 4/15 with activations 2.688\u20132.734. The top plural (3.906) notably exceeds the top singular (2.734) by ~1.17.\n- Pattern 3: Strong co-occurrence with \u201cproduction/return\u201d verbs immediately to the left: \u201cproduce/produced\u201d (Ex. 1\u20132, 9), \u201cyielded/yielded no\u201d (Ex. 3\u20134, 10\u201313), \u201creturn\u201d (Ex. 14\u201315), \u201cgave/getting\u201d (Ex. 5, 7\u20138). Despite this, only the noun \u201cresult(s)\u201d token spikes.\n- Pattern 4: Frequent quality/quantity modifiers adjacent to \u201cresult(s)\u201d: \u201cdifferent\u201d (Ex. 3\u20134, 14\u201315), \u201cdisappointing\u201d (Ex. 9), \u201cno\u201d (Ex. 10\u201311), \u201cinconsistent/inconclusive\u201d (Ex. 12\u201313), \u201cgood/right\u201d (Ex. 5, 7\u20138). These do not themselves activate.\n- Common elements: noun \u201cresult(s)\u201d denoting outcomes; appears as object/complement of verbs like yield/produce/return/give/get; often modified by evaluative/quantifier adjectives; cross-domain usage (science, computing/search, business aphorism); activation localized strictly to the \u201cresult(s)\u201d token.\n\n[HYPOTHESIS LIST]:\nHypothesis_1: The feature encodes the lexical concept of the plural noun \u201cresults\u201d (outcomes) and will strongly activate on the token \u201cresults\u201d across domains. Prediction: Sentences with \u201c\u2026 results \u2026\u201d (e.g., \u201cexperimental results\u201d, \u201csearch results\u201d, \u201cproduce results\u201d) will elicit high activation on the \u201cresults\u201d token, typically >2.5 and potentially ~3.5\u20133.9 based on exemplars (max 3.906 observed).\n\nHypothesis_2: The feature also responds to the singular noun \u201cresult\u201d but more weakly than the plural. Prediction: Minimal pairs (\u201cThis produced results.\u201d vs \u201cThis produced a result.\u201d) will show higher activation on \u201cresults\u201d than on \u201cresult\u201d by ~0.7\u20131.2 on average (exemplar top: 3.906 vs 2.734).\n\nHypothesis_3: Negative control \u2014 The feature is selective for the noun sense and will not strongly activate for the verb \u201cresult\u201d (\u201cmay result in \u2026\u201d) or the idiom \u201cas a result\u201d. Prediction: In \u201cThis may result in delays.\u201d and \u201cAs a result, \u2026\u201d, activation on \u201cresult\u201d will be low (<0.5), substantially below noun-usage cases.\n\nHypothesis_4: Production/measurement context boosts activation relative to neutral contexts. Prediction: When \u201cresults\u201d is the direct object of verbs like \u201cyield/produce/return/give/get\u201d (e.g., \u201cyielded no results\u201d, \u201creturn different results\u201d), activation will be higher than in copular or static contexts (e.g., \u201cThe results are posted.\u201d or \u201cThese are the results.\u201d). Expect measurable elevation (e.g., \u201cproduce/return/yield + results\u201d > \u201cresults are \u2026\u201d).\n\nHypothesis_5: The feature is wordform-specific and will not strongly activate for near-synonyms lacking the \u201cresult(s)\u201d string (e.g., \u201coutcomes\u201d, \u201cfindings\u201d). Prediction: \u201cThe outcomes were inconclusive.\u201d and \u201cThe findings were inconclusive.\u201d will show low activation on those tokens, far below \u201cThe results were inconclusive.\u201d",

The token ' results' shows high activation (2.7031), exceeding the expected >2.5 threshold for plural noun \u201cresults\u201d in a search/return context.

The feature strongly activates on the singular noun: ' result'=3.0938. However, compared to the plural test in a similar frame (\u201cThe search returned no results.\u201d \u2192 ' results'=2.7031), the singular here is higher, contradicting the \u201cweaker than plural\u201d prediction. This suggests context (e.g., negation \u201cno\u201d vs determiner \u201ca\u201d) can modulate magnitude more than number.\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: REFINED\nEvidence: Strong activation on singular (' result'=3.0938) shows responsiveness, but it is not reliably weaker than plural (plural in similar prompt was 2.7031). Refined: The feature responds strongly to both \u201cresult\u201d and \u201cresults\u201d; relative strength depends on context (e.g., negation) rather than strictly on plurality.",

The verb usage in \"This may result in delays.\" shows no activation on ' result' (0.0000), matching the prediction of low (<0.5) activation for non-noun senses. All tokens remain at 0.0000.\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: CONFIRMED\nEvidence: Zero activation on the verb token ' result' (0.0000) in a \u201cmay result in \u2026\u201d construction supports selectivity for the noun sense and not the verb/idiom usage.",

In a production/measurement verb-object context (\u201cyielded \u2026 results\u201d), the token ' results' shows very high activation (4.3438), well above the expected >2.5 threshold and higher than other tested contexts, indicating boosted activation when \u201cresults\u201d is produced/yielded.\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: CONFIRMED\nEvidence: The sentence \u201cThe experiment yielded consistent results.\u201d yields ' results'=4.3438, supporting that production/measurement contexts boost activation on \u201cresults\u201d relative to more neutral uses.",

This necessitates refining H2 to emphasize strong response to both forms with context-driven magnitude.

However, with only one test and no complementary checks on other synonyms (e.g., \u201cfindings\u201d, \u201coutcomes\u201d in varied contexts) or direct contrasts against \u201cresults\u201d in the same frame, confirmation would be premature.

The noun ' result' in a production verb-object context shows very high activation (4.2500), demonstrating strong responsiveness to the singular form.
