    "OBSERVATION:\n- Pattern 1: The max-activation token is consistently the exact token \" build\" (leading space) in all top exemplars, with strong activations ranging from 2.266 to 4.469 on that token alone; all surrounding tokens in the buffer have 0.000 activation.\n- Pattern 2: Morphological variant \" building\" also activates but with lower magnitude (e.g., 2.312 vs 3.5\u20134.469 for \" build\").\n- Pattern 3: Frequent syntactic frames are catenative/infinitival constructions: \"needed to build\" (4.469), \"to build\" (3.547), \"help build\" (3.891), \"in order to build\" (2.922), \"is to build\" (2.266), and a prepositional \"for building\" (2.312). \n- Pattern 4: Semantic objects vary widely (apps, software, detector, network, request, value, capacity, strategies), indicating semantics of the object do not drive activation; the lexeme \"build\" does.\n- Common elements: \n  - Presence of the string \" build\" or \" building\"\n  - Often preceded by function words (\"to\", \"help\", \"in order to\", \"for\")\n  - Mid-sentence occurrences (leading-space tokenization)\n  - Other tokens in context show 0.000 activation, suggesting high lexical specificity\n\n[HYPOTHESIS LIST]:\nHypothesis_1: Feature 72252 is a lexical detector for the exact token \" build\" (with leading space) and will strongly activate whenever \" build\" appears mid-sentence, regardless of the direct object (e.g., \"to build a house\", \"help build value\"). Prediction: \" build\" will produce the maximal activation in such sentences, often >3.\n\nHypothesis_2: The feature shows weaker activation for morphological variants, with \" building\" activating moderately (\u22482\u20133), while \"built\", \"builds\", \"builder\", and \"rebuild\" will activate less or not at all. Prediction: \" building\" > \" built\"/\" builds\"/\" builder\"/\" rebuild\" in activation magnitude.\n\nHypothesis_3 (Negative control): Semantically similar verbs without the token \" build\" (e.g., \"construct\", \"create\", \"develop\", \"make\") will not activate this feature (near 0 activation on those tokens), demonstrating lexical rather than semantic detection.\n\nHypothesis_4: Token-boundary/case sensitivity: \"Build\" at sentence start (no leading space) and hyphenated/compounded forms (\"build-up\", \"rebuild\") will produce reduced or no activation compared to mid-sentence \" build\". Prediction: \" Build a house.\" < \" to build a house.\" in activation on the corresponding token.",

The token ' build' is indeed the maximal and only nonzero activation (1.9062), supporting lexical detection of mid-sentence \" build\". However, the activation is below the predicted strong magnitude (>3), indicating the strength is lower than expected in this context.\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: REFINED\nEvidence: ' build' activated as the top token (1.9062) but not strongly (>3).

Although ' building' is the maximal token, its activation is 0.1230\u2014far below the predicted moderate range (\u22482\u20133). All other tokens are 0.0000, providing no support for the expected strength.\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: REFUTED\nEvidence: The tested morphological variant \" building\" produced only 0.1230 activation, contradicting the hypothesis that it would activate moderately (\u22482\u20133). Any revision should state that \"building\" yields minimal activation; relative ordering vs. other variants remains untested.",

Sentence-initial 'Build' (no leading space, capitalized) shows zero activation, matching the prediction of reduced/no activation compared to mid-sentence ' build'. This contrasts with prior mid-sentence ' build' activation of 1.9062 and corpus highs (2.266\u20134.469).\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: CONFIRMED\nEvidence: 'Build a house.' yields 'Build'=0.0000, substantially lower than mid-sentence ' build' in tests and exemplars, confirming token-boundary/case sensitivity for sentence-initial usage (hyphenated/compounded forms not yet tested).",

Corpus exemplars show higher values (2.266\u20134.469), suggesting context sensitivity. No corpus tokens \u226510.0 exist, so high-activation coverage is trivially satisfied; additional tests are needed to determine conditions producing stronger activations.",

All other tokens were 0.0000, contradicting the claim that \"building\" would activate moderately.\n\nSTATUS ASSESSMENT:\nCurrent Status: REFUTED\nReason: The sole test directly contradicts the central prediction for \"building\" (expected \u22482\u20133, observed 0.1230). While relative ordering versus \"built/builds/builder/rebuild\" remains untested, the key claim about \"building\" is false. Corpus coverage check: no exemplars \u226510.0, so coverage criterion is trivially satisfied; however, critical tests are missing for other variants, so conclusions about their ordering are pending.",

This is reduced relative to mid-sentence ' build' in \"We need to build a robust API.\" with ' build'=1.9062, and consistent with corpus exemplars where mid-sentence ' build' reached 2.266\u20134.469.\n\nSTATUS ASSESSMENT:\nCurrent Status: CONFIRMED\nReason: The token-boundary/case sensitivity prediction is supported: sentence-initial 'Build' shows zero activation, whereas mid-sentence ' build' activates. This matches the hypothesis of reduced/no activation without a leading space.

The token ' build' is the maximal and only nonzero activation (0.7500), matching the claim that the feature lexically targets mid-sentence \" build\" and peaks there, with context-dependent magnitude. This aligns with the prior test where ' build'=1.9062.\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: CONFIRMED\nEvidence: Across two tests, ' build' is consistently the sole nonzero and maximal token (1.9062 in \"We need to build a robust API.\" and 0.7500 in \"Our team plans to build a prototype today.\"), confirming lexical detection with variable strength.",
