    "content": "OBSERVATION:\n- Pattern 1: The max-activation token is consistently the exact token \" build\" (leading space) in all top exemplars, with strong activations ranging from 2.266 to 4.469 on that token alone; all surrounding tokens in the buffer have 0.000 activation.\n- Pattern 2: Morphological variant \" building\" also activates but with lower magnitude (e.g., 2.312 vs 3.5–4.469 for \" build\").\n- Pattern 3: Frequent syntactic frames are catenative/infinitival constructions: \"needed to build\" (4.469), \"to build\" (3.547), \"help build\" (3.891), \"in order to build\" (2.922), \"is to build\" (2.266), and a prepositional \"for building\" (2.312). \n- Pattern 4: Semantic objects vary widely (apps, software, detector, network, request, value, capacity, strategies), indicating semantics of the object do not drive activation; the lexeme \"build\" does.\n- Common elements: \n  - Presence of the string \" build\" or \" building\"\n  - Often preceded by function words (\"to\", \"help\", \"in order to\", \"for\")\n  - Mid-sentence occurrences (leading-space tokenization)\n  - Other tokens in context show 0.000 activation, suggesting high lexical specificity\n\n[HYPOTHESIS LIST]:\nHypothesis_1: Feature 72252 is a lexical detector for the exact token \" build\" (with leading space) and will strongly activate whenever \" build\" appears mid-sentence, regardless of the direct object (e.g., \"to build a house\", \"help build value\"). Prediction: \" build\" will produce the maximal activation in such sentences, often >3.\n\nHypothesis_2: The feature shows weaker activation for morphological variants, with \" building\" activating moderately (≈2–3), while \"built\", \"builds\", \"builder\", and \"rebuild\" will activate less or not at all. Prediction: \" building\" > \" built\"/\" builds\"/\" builder\"/\" rebuild\" in activation magnitude.\n\nHypothesis_3 (Negative control): Semantically similar verbs without the token \" build\" (e.g., \"construct\", \"create\", \"develop\", \"make\") will not activate this feature (near 0 activation on those tokens), demonstrating lexical rather than semantic detection.\n\nHypothesis_4: Token-boundary/case sensitivity: \"Build\" at sentence start (no leading space) and hyphenated/compounded forms (\"build-up\", \"rebuild\") will produce reduced or no activation compared to mid-sentence \" build\". Prediction: \" Build a house.\" < \" to build a house.\" in activation on the corresponding token."

Identify ALL tokens with activation ≥10.0 from corpus exemplars (Round 2)\n2. Verify each token was tested in at least ONE synthetic test prompt\n3. If ALL tested → \"Can conclude: YES\"; If ANY untested → \"Can conclude: NO\" (list untested tokens)\n4. Exception: Round ≥15 → Can conclude despite gaps\n\n**Conclusion Assessment**:\n1. Can we draw conclusions now? (YES/NO)\n2. Do we have sufficient evidence? (≥3 tests, ≥10 rounds OR confirmed pattern)\n3. Corpus coverage: Have all high-activation tokens (≥10.0) been tested?\n4. Are there critical tests missing? (Be specific if NO)\n\n**Rules**:\n- Do NOT issue [TOOL] commands\n- **MANDATORY**: After 2+ test results, UNCHANGED is FORBIDDEN\n- **MANDATORY**: Prefer CONFIRMED/REFUTED when evidence is strong; Use REFINED when evidence is weak/ambiguous\n- **MANDATORY**: Check corpus coverage before concluding\n- Be honest about evidence sufficiency; don't wait for \"perfect\" consistency\n"

    "content": "HYPOTHESIS UPDATES:\n- H1 (STATUS): CONFIRMED\n  Evidence: In \"We need to build a robust API.\", ' build' was maximal at 1.9062 with all other tokens 0.0000. In \"Our team plans to build a prototype today.\", ' build' was maximal at 0.7500 with all other tokens 0.0000. This confirms lexical detection of mid-sentence \" build\" with context-dependent magnitude.\n\nSTATUS ASSESSMENT:\nCurrent Status: CONFIRMED\nReason: Two tests consistently show ' build' as the sole nonzero and maximal token (1.9062; 0.7500), matching the refined claim of reliable lexical targeting with variable strength. This aligns with corpus exemplars where mid-sentence ' build' also peaks (2.266–4.469). Corpus coverage check: no exemplars ≥10.0, so coverage is satisfied. Conclusion: YES—evidence sufficient with 2 consistent tests supporting the refined hypothesis."

    "content": "REVIEW SUMMARY:\n- H1: Confirmed. Consistently peaks on the exact mid-sentence token \" build\" with context-dependent magnitude (1.9062; 0.7500; 1.9062); synonym control \"construct\" showed 0.0000.\n- H2: Refuted overall, but context-sensitive. Progressive \"building\" was low (0.1230), other variants \"built/builds/builder\" were 0.0000, yet \"for building\" frames showed nonzero activation (1.6953; 1.2734), indicating a specific PP context effect.\n- H3: Confirmed. Boundary/case/compounding insensitivity supported: sentence-initial \"Build\", prefixed \"rebuild\", and hyphenated \"build-up\" all 0.0000.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n- Are all hypotheses adequately tested? Partially. H1 has strong evidence but could include a corpus-matched “in order to build” frame. H2 needs mapping of the “for building” context vs. noun “building”. H3 is strong but capitalization mid-sentence remains untested; another compound like “build-out” would round it out.\n- Gaps in evidence:\n  - H1: Direct test of “in order to build …” frame from corpus.\n  - H2: Distinguish gerund in “for building X” vs. noun “building” (e.g., “The building is old.”).\n  - H3: Mid-sentence capitalized “ Build” and another hyphenated compound (e.g., “build-out”).\n- Contradictions: None. Results are consistent with a primarily lexical detector for \" build\", with limited spillover to \" building\" in specific PP contexts.\n\nDECISION:\nNeed more testing: YES\n- H1: \"In order to build a request.\"\n- H1: \"We plan to develop software.\"\n- H2: \"This is for building trust.\"\n- H2: \"The building is old.\"\n- H3: \"We will Build together.\"\n- H3: \"It needs a build-out.\""
