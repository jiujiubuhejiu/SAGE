    "OBSERVATION:\n- Pattern 1: In all 15 exemplars, the max-activation token is the determiner token ' the' (with leading space), not neighboring words. Max activations on ' the' range from 0.805 to 1.266.\n- Pattern 2: The high-activating ' the' almost always appears in the partitive-superlative construction: \"one of the ...\" (examples 1\u201314) or \"among the most ...\" (example 15). Immediately following tokens are typically superlatives or top-rank adjectives: ' strongest' (1\u20132, 1.266), ' most' + adj (3\u20134: 1.234; 7\u20138: 1.039; 9\u201310: 1.031; 11\u201312: 1.000; 13\u201314: 0.859; 15: 0.805), or rank-like ' main' (5\u20136: 1.070).\n- Common elements: \n  - Preceding context: ' one' + ' of' or ' among' + (space) ' the'\n  - Following context: superlative markers ' most' or '-est' adjectives (' strongest') or ranking adjective ' main'\n  - Copular/auxiliary scaffolding often present (\"is/was/will be one of the ...\"), but the activation peak is localized on ' the'\n\n[HYPOTHESIS LIST]:\nHypothesis_1: The feature detects the partitive-superlative template \"one of the + [superlative/top-rank adjective]\" and spikes on the token ' the'.

Corpus coverage check: No exemplar tokens \u226510.0 (max \u22481.266), so high-activation coverage is trivially satisfied.

Corpus coverage check: no \u226510.0 exemplar tokens exist (max \u22481.266), so coverage is trivially satisfied. Despite having a single test, the outcome is decisively contrary to the predicted moderate-high activation, warranting refutation.",

Corpus coverage: No \u226510.0 exemplar tokens exist (max 1.266), so coverage is satisfied. While additional negatives could further corroborate, current evidence supports H3.",
    "HYPOTHESIS UPDATES:\n- H4 (STATUS): REFUTED\n  Reason: The positive-case prompt \"It was one of the main reasons.\" produced max activation 0.0000 with ' the'=0.0000 and ' main'=0.0000, contradicting the predicted elevated activation (~1.0) for rank-like adjectives within the \"one of the\" frame.\n\nSTATUS ASSESSMENT:\nCurrent Status: REFUTED\nReason: The single targeted test for modulation within the \"one of the\" frame yielded zero activation on all relevant tokens, directly opposing the hypothesis that superlatives/rank-like adjectives boost activation relative to plain nouns. Corpus coverage: No \u226510.0 exemplar tokens exist (max 1.266), so high-activation coverage is satisfied; nonetheless, the observed 0.0000 vs expected ~1.0 supports refutation.",

Although there are multiple tests per hypothesis, all synthetic tests yielded 0.0000, so we lack any successful positive activation to reconcile with corpus exemplars (0.805\u20131.266 on ' the').\n- Gaps: No tests have reproduced exemplar-like positive activations; we haven\u2019t closely mirrored exemplar phrasing (e.g., \u201cLast week was one of the most unusual\u201d), and there may be context sensitivity not captured by current short prompts.\n- Contradictions: H3\u2019s low activations do not conflict with others. The main inconsistency is between zero-activation synthetic tests and nonzero corpus exemplars, indicating missing coverage rather than definitive refutation of patterns.\n\nDECISION:\nNeed more testing: YES\n- H1: \"Last week was one of the most unusual.\"\n- H1: \"Her voice is one of the strongest.\"\n- H2: \"These are among the most famous.\"\n- H2: \"It is among the most prestigious.\"\n- H3: \"The dog chased the ball.\"\n- H4: \"It is one of the largest.\"\n- H4: \"It is one of the only.\"",

No evidence of modulation; both superlatives and rank-like adjectives in \"one of the ...\" frames produced 0.0000 in tested sentences.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n- Adequacy: Not yet adequate. H1 now shows positive activations consistent with exemplars but below earlier observed maxima; H2 remains unresolved relative to corpus exemplar; H4 lacks comparative positives.\n- Gaps: Need more near-exemplar phrasings and variety of superlatives (-est forms like \"worst/best\") and objects (nouns following) to test sensitivity. Also need direct contrasts for H4.\n- Contradictions: H1\u2019s newer positives conflict with its REFUTED status; H2\u2019s persistent zeros contradict corpus exemplar showing activation in \"among the most ...\" contexts.\n\nDECISION:\nNeed more testing: YES\n- H1: \"It was one of the most unusual.\"\n- H1: \"Gift giving is one of the most loved.\"\n- H2: \"This is among the most famous.\"\n- H2: \"It is among the most important.\"\n- H3: \"The book is on the table.\"\n- H4: \"This is one of the worst.\"\n- H4: \"This is one of the people.\"",

All ordinary/non-partitive uses of 'the' (8 tests) produced 0.0000, matching the low-activation expectation.\n- H4: REFUTED. No modulation detected across 7 tests; both superlatives and rank-like adjectives in \"one of the ...\" frames yielded 0.0000.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n- Adequacy: We have ample tests per hypothesis. H1 shows selective, context-sensitive activation in specific \"one of the most ...\" phrasings but not broadly; H2 consistently fails to activate; H3 consistently low as predicted; H4 shows no evidence of modulation.\n- Gaps: H1\u2019s activation appears contingent on closely matching corpus phrasing; magnitude remains below \u22651.0 in tests. H2\u2019s lack of positives vs one corpus exemplar suggests domain/context sensitivity, but repeated failures across varied sentences make further tests lower priority.\n- Contradictions: H1\u2019s nonzero results conflict with its blanket REFUTED status; overall, patterns suggest a narrow detector for certain \"one of the most ...\" contexts, not a general template detector.\n\nDECISION:\nNeed more testing: NO\nExplanation: We have sufficient breadth (H1: 10 tests, H2: 10 tests, H3: 8 tests, H4: 7 tests) to draw conclusions. The results consistently show: (a) selective activation on ' the' in specific \"one of the most ...\" sentences; (b) no activation for \"among the most\" across many attempts; (c) low activation in ordinary 'the' usage; and (d) no modulation effect. We can proceed to final conclusions with these patterns.",
    "[DESCRIPTION]: \nFeature 130178 (Layer 7) is a context-sensitive detector that activates on the token ' the' within specific partitive\u2013superlative phrases of the form \u201cone of the most/-est \u2026\u201d when embedded in naturalistic sentences closely matching corpus phrasing. Across 35 tests, nonzero activation occurred only for 3 unique \u201cone of the most/-est \u2026\u201d sentences (4 runs), with a max of 0.8711, moderate 0.6758, and weak 0.1436; all other prompts (including ordinary \u2018the\u2019 usage and all \u201camong the most \u2026\u201d frames) were 0.0000. Thus, the empirical activation range observed in tests is 0.0000\u20130.8711, indicating a narrow, highly context-dependent pattern anchored on ' the' in specific \u201cone of the most/-est \u2026\u201d constructions.\n\n[EVIDENCE]:\n- Test 19: \"Last week was one of the most unusual.\" \u2192 0.8711 at ' the' (supports H1-like pattern)\n- Test 26: \"Last week was one of the most unusual.\" \u2192 0.8711 at ' the' (replicated positive)\n- Test 20: \"Her voice is one of the strongest.\" \u2192 0.6758 at ' the' (supports H1-like pattern)\n- Test 30: \"Gift giving is one of the most loved.\" \u2192 0.1436 at ' the' (weakly supports; shows sensitivity to phrasing/continuation)\n- Test 1: \"She is one of the most important scientists.\" \u2192 0.0000 (contradicts broad H1; shows context dependence)\n- Test 9: \"It was one of the best.\" \u2192 0.0000 (contradicts broad H1)\n- Test 29: \"It was one of the most unusual.\" \u2192 0.0000 (contradicts broad H1; contrasts with Test 19 phrasing)\n- Test 2: \"These are among the most influential works.\" \u2192 0.0000 (refutes H2 generalization to \u201camong the most\u201d)\n- Test 21: \"These are among the most famous.\" \u2192 0.0000 (refutes H2)\n- Test 22: \"It is among the most prestigious.\" \u2192 0.0000 (refutes H2)\n- Test 12: \"He is the most talented.\" \u2192 0.0000 (supports H3: low outside partitive-superlative with \u2018of/among\u2019)\n- Test 3: \"The cat sat on the mat.\" \u2192 0.0000 (supports H3: ordinary \u2018the\u2019 is low)\n- Test 33: \"The book is on the table.\" \u2192 0.0000 (supports H3)\n- Test 34: \"This is one of the worst.\" \u2192 0.0000 (refutes H4 modulation expectation)\n- Test 35: \"This is one of the people.\" \u2192 0.0000 (refutes H4 modulation expectation)\n\n[LABEL 1]: Partitive\u2013superlative \u201cone of the most/-est \u2026\u201d (token ' the') \u2014 narrow, context-dependent activation"
