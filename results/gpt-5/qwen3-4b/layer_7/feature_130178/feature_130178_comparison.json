      "description": "Feature 130178 (Layer 7) is a context-sensitive detector that activates on the token ' the' within specific partitive–superlative phrases of the form “one of the most/-est …” when embedded in naturalistic sentences closely matching corpus phrasing. Across 35 tests, nonzero activation occurred only for 3 unique “one of the most/-est …” sentences (4 runs), with a max of 0.8711, moderate 0.6758, and weak 0.1436; all other prompts (including ordinary ‘the’ usage and all “among the most …” frames) were 0.0000. Thus, the empirical activation range observed in tests is 0.0000–0.8711, indicating a narrow, highly context-dependent pattern anchored on ' the' in specific “one of the most/-est …” constructions.",
