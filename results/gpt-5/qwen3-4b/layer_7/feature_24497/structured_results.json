    "OBSERVATION:\n- Pattern 1: Activation is sharply localized on the token \u201c tab\u201d (and \u201c tabs\u201d), with all surrounding tokens at 0.000. Examples:\n  - \u201c... window or tab ...\u201d \u2192 \u2018 tab\u2019: 14.500 (highest)\n  - \u201c... one tab bar ...\u201d \u2192 \u2018 tab\u2019: 12.812\n  - \u201cSwitching tab ...\u201d \u2192 \u2018 tab\u2019: 12.500\n  - \u201c... different tab or window ...\u201d \u2192 \u2018 tab\u2019: 12.250\n  - \u201c... the tabs in ...\u201d \u2192 \u2018 tabs\u2019: 11.938\n- Pattern 2: The feature also fires when \u201ctab\u201d is a subword at token boundaries, e.g., \u201ctablix\u201d tokenized as \u2018 tab\u2019: 11.562 followed by \u2018lix\u2019: 0.000.\n- Pattern 3: The highest activations correspond to the standalone token \u201c tab\u201d in UI/navigation contexts (\u201ctab bar\u201d, \u201ctab or window\u201d, \u201cbrowser tabs\u201d), but only the \u201c tab/ tabs\u201d token itself carries activation; nearby UI words (\u201cwindow\u201d, \u201cbar\u201d, \u201cbrowsers\u201d) remain at 0.000.\n- Common elements: lower-case \u2018 tab\u2019 or \u2018 tabs\u2019 tokens; UI/navigation contexts (browser/app tabs, tab bar, switching tabs); activation strictly tied to the \u2018 tab/ tabs\u2019 token; plural \u2018 tabs\u2019 and subword prefix cases show strong but slightly lower activations than singular \u2018 tab\u2019.\n\n[HYPOTHESIS LIST]:\nHypothesis_1: The feature is a lexical detector for the BPE tokens \u201c tab\u201d and \u201c tabs\u201d, with strongest activation on the standalone lower-case \u2018 tab\u2019 (~14\u201315), slightly lower on \u2018 tabs\u2019 (~11\u201312), and still positive when \u2018 tab\u2019 appears as a subword prefix (e.g., \u201c tab\u201d + \u201clix\u201d in \u201ctablix\u201d, ~11\u201312).\n\nHypothesis_2: The feature primarily encodes the UI/navigation concept of tabs (e.g., \u201ctab bar\u201d, \u201cbrowser tab\u201d), but its activation is largely context-independent and driven by the presence of the \u2018 tab/ tabs\u2019 token; therefore sentences like \u201cPress the tab key\u201d or \u201copen a new tab\u201d will also strongly activate via \u2018 tab\u2019.\n\nHypothesis_3: Negative control \u2014 Words that begin with \u201ctab\u201d but are tokenized without a separate \u2018 tab\u2019 subtoken (e.g., \u201ctable\u201d, \u201ctablet\u201d) will show low/near-zero activation; in contrast, words that split into \u2018 tab\u2019 + suffix (e.g., \u201ctablix\u201d, \u201ctabular\u201d if tokenized as \u2018 tab\u2019 + \u2018ular\u2019) will activate on the \u2018 tab\u2019 subtoken while the suffix remains near zero.\n\nHypothesis_4: Case/form sensitivity \u2014 The feature is tuned to the lower-case token form \u2018 tab/ tabs\u2019. Capitalized \u201cTab\u201d or all-caps \u201cTAB\u201d (if mapped to different tokens like \u2018 Tab\u2019 or \u2018 TAB\u2019) will yield reduced activation compared to lower-case \u2018 tab\u2019, whereas hyphenated or concatenated forms that still produce a \u2018 tab\u2019 subtoken (e.g., \u201ctab-bar\u201d \u2192 \u2018 tab\u2019, \u2018-\u2019, \u2018bar\u2019) will activate on the \u2018 tab\u2019 piece.",

The test shows strong, localized activation on the lexical items: highest on standalone ' tab' (8.3125), positive on ' tabs' (7.1250), and positive on ' tab' as a subword in 'tablix' (7.1250).

The non-UI context \u201cPress the tab key to indent.\u201d still yields strong activation on the lexical token ' tab' (7.8125), supporting the claim that activation is largely driven by the presence of ' tab' regardless of context. Neighboring tokens are near zero (' key'=0.1572), indicating localized lexical detection. Magnitude is lower than corpus maxima (~14.5 for UI contexts), suggesting context can modulate strength but is not required for activation.\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: REFINED\nEvidence: The feature activates on ' tab' in a keyboard (non-UI-navigation) context (7.8125), indicating context-independent lexical triggering; revise emphasis to: \u201cFeature is primarily a lexical detector for ' tab'/' tabs' that often appears in UI/navigation text, with context modulating intensity rather than being necessary.\u201d",

    "[DESCRIPTION]: \nFeature 24497 (Layer 7) is a lexical detector for the whitespace-prefixed tokens \u2018 tab\u2019 and \u2018 tabs\u2019, with case/form sensitivity and subtoken behavior. Across 9 tests, standalone lower-case \u2018 tab\u2019 consistently shows the highest activation (~7.7\u20138.3), plural \u2018 tabs\u2019 is lower (~5.7\u20137.1), and \u2018 tab\u2019 as a subword prefix (e.g., in \u201ctablix\u201d, \u201ctabular\u201d) also activates (~6.2\u20137.1) while the suffix tokens remain ~0; capitalized/all-caps variants activate but are reduced (\u2018 Tab\u2019=7.31, \u2018 Tabs\u2019=6.94, \u2018 TAB\u2019=4.72). Negative controls where no separate \u2018 tab\u2019 subtoken exists (e.g., \u201ctable\u201d, \u201ctablet\u201d) yield ~0, indicating context-independent lexical triggering governed by tokenization.\n\n[EVIDENCE]:\n- Test 1: 'Click the tab to open new tabs in the tablix report.' \u2192 activation 8.3125 at ' tab' (supports H1; \u2018 tabs\u2019=7.1250; \u2018 tab\u2019 in \u2018tablix\u2019=7.1250; \u2018lix\u2019=0.0000)\n- Test 2: 'Press the tab key to indent.' \u2192 activation 7.8125 at ' tab' (supports H2; neighbors near zero: \u2018 key\u2019=0.1572)\n- Test 3: 'The table was converted into a tablix for the report.' \u2192 activation 6.1562 at ' tab' (supports H3; \u2018 table\u2019=0.0000; \u2018lix\u2019=0.0000)\n- Test 4: 'Click the Tab, press TAB, then open the tab-bar and view the tabs.' \u2192 activation 8.1875 at ' tab' (supports H4; case ranking: \u2018 Tab\u2019=7.3125 > \u2018 TAB\u2019=4.7188 < \u2018 tab\u2019; \u2018 tabs\u2019=6.0938; \u2018-bar\u2019=0.0000)\n- Test 5: 'Select the tab to view all tabs in the tabular report.' \u2192 activation 8.1250 at ' tab' (supports H1/H3; \u2018 tabs\u2019=7.0625; \u2018 tab\u2019 in \u2018tabular\u2019=6.1875; \u2018ular\u2019=0.0000)\n- Test 6: 'Use a tab delimiter instead of tabs.' \u2192 activation 7.6562 at ' tab' (supports H2; \u2018 tabs\u2019=5.7188; \u2018 delimiter\u2019=0.1201)\n- Test 7: 'Open a new tab.' \u2192 activation 8.3125 at ' tab' (supports H1)\n- Test 8: 'The tablet crashed today.' \u2192 activation 0.0000 across tokens (supports H3; \u2018 tablet\u2019=0.0000)\n- Test 9: 'Open the Tabs menu.' \u2192 activation 6.9375 at ' Tabs' (supports H4; capitalized plural activates but below lower-case \u2018 tab\u2019)\n\n[LABEL 1]: Lexical detector for \u2018 tab\u2019/\u2018 tabs\u2019 (UI \u201ctab\u201d tokens), case/form-sensitive and subtoken-aware, context-independent"
