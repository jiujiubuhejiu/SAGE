Prediction: \u201cLung cancer\u201d at line start (\u201cL\u201d + \u201cung\u201d) will yield higher activation (\u22486.4\u20136.8) than \u201clung\u201d in other contexts (\u22485.5\u20136.5). Control: \u201clung function tests\u201d should activate on \u201c lung\u201d but somewhat lower than line-initial \u201cLung cancer.\u201d\n\nHypothesis_3: The feature is selective to the stem \u201clung,\u201d not generic \u201c-ung\u201d substrings. Words containing \u201cung\u201d but not the organ (e.g., \u201cyoung,\u201d \u201camong,\u201d \u201cplunge,\u201d \u201cfungus,\u201d \u201cHungary\u201d) will not activate strongly (expected \u22480.0\u2013<0.5 on \u201cung\u201d). Control: \u201cbreast cancer,\u201d \u201ckidney cancer,\u201d or \u201cmelanoma\u201d should also yield \u22480.0 on those tokens.\n\nHypothesis_4: Structural and morphological specificity: activation is enhanced for line-initial/title-case \u201cLung ...\u201d and plain \u201clung\u201d as head noun, but reduced/variable when embedded in complex hyphenations (e.g., \u201csmall-cell lung cancer,\u201d \u201cnon-small-cell lung cancer\u201d) or pluralized/synonymized. Prediction: \n- \u201cLung cancer kills ...\u201d (line start) \u2192 high \u201cung\u201d (~6.4\u20136.8).\n- \u201c... small-cell lung cancer ...\u201d \u2192 \u201c lung\u201d lower or possibly ~0\u20135 depending on context; hyphenated modifiers may suppress.\n- \u201clungs\u201d and \u201cpulmonary\u201d will show lower activation than singular \u201clung\u201d (potentially near 0 for \u201cpulmonary\u201d).",

Both low, confirming suppression in hyphenated oncology contexts.\n\nSTATUS ASSESSMENT:\nCurrent Status: CONFIRMED\nReason: Two independent hyphenated phrases produce only low activation on ' lung' (0.1406, 0.2891) with all other tokens 0.0000, consistent with the refined claim of suppression under hyphenation. Corpus coverage: no \u226510.0 tokens in exemplars (top \u22486.75), so coverage criterion is met. Remaining untested aspects (line-initial/title-case enhancement, plain non-hyphenated \u201c lung\u201d, plurals/synonyms) do not affect confirmation of the suppression claim.",

H1 and H2 each have only one test and contradict corpus exemplars showing high activations near \u201clung/Lung\u201d.\n- Gaps: No test for plain mid-sentence \u201c lung\u201d without hyphenation; no replication of exemplar-style title phrase (\u201cLung Cancer Causes Without Smoking\u201d); no simple baseline \u201cHe has lung cancer.\u201d; no mid-sentence plain \u201clung\u201d (e.g., \u201cThe lung is vital.\u201d).\n- No direct contradictions between confirmed hypotheses (H3, H4) and refuted ones (H1, H2); rather, current tests suggest context sensitivity not yet probed.\n\nDECISION:\nNeed more testing: YES\n- H1: \"The lung is vital.\"\n- H1: \"He studied lung physiology.\"\n- H2: \"Lung cancer kills thousands.\"\n- H2: \"He developed lung cancer.\"\n- H2: \"Lung Cancer Causes Without Smoking\"\n- H4: \"He has lung cancer.\"\n- H4: \"They treat non small cell lung cancer.\"",
    "REVIEW SUMMARY:\n- H1: REFUTED. Initial claim of strong activation on \u201clung/Lung\u201d (>5) does not hold; line-initial \u201cLung \u2026\u201d yields ~0.04, while mid-sentence \u201c lung\u201d shows only modest activation (\u22481.3\u20131.7).\n- H2: REFUTED.

H1/H2 are refuted, but additional tests can clarify case sensitivity (lowercase sentence-initial \u201clung\u201d) and morphology (plural \u201clungs\u201d, synonym \u201cpulmonary\u201d) to finalize the feature\u2019s scope.\n- Gaps: No tests for plural \u201clungs\u201d or synonym \u201cpulmonary\u201d. Limited probing of sentence-initial lowercase \u201clung\u201d (tokenization may differ from space-prefixed \u201c lung\u201d).\n- No contradictions: H3\u2019s non-activation on generic \u201c-ung\u201d aligns with H1/H2 refutations and H4 suppression behavior.\n\nDECISION:\nNeed more testing: YES\n- H1: \"lung function tests.\"\n- H4: \"The lungs are vital.\"\n- H4: \"Pulmonary disease is common.\"",
