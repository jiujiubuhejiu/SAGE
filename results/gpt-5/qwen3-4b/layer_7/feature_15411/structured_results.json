Also words that contain the substring but are different tokens (e.g., \u201cevery\u201d, \u201cforever\u201d if tokenized as a single token) will not strongly activate.\n\nHypothesis_4: The feature is sensitive to the \u201cHave you ever \u2026\u201d interrogative template and yields higher activations for that pattern than for declarative \u201cI\u2019ve/I have never \u2026\u201d statements (consistent with ~9.4 vs ~9.0 maxima).

Important edge cases (substring forms like \"every\"/\"forever\") and comparative interrogative vs declarative strength remain under-tested.\n- Gaps: \n  - H2: Only one non-present-perfect 'ever' case; need additional non-PP contexts and 'never' outside PP.\n  - H3: Substring negatives (\"every\", \"forever\") untested.\n  - H4: Matched declarative control for direct comparison with interrogatives is missing.\n  - H1: Additional PP variants (different subjects/aux contractions) would strengthen generality.\n- Contradictions: None.

Interrogative present perfect yields modest activation on ' ever' (0.7500; 1.3438). Comparative note: declarative ' never' is stronger (~3.3750) than interrogative ' ever' in our tests.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n- Adequacy: Mostly adequate. H1 and H4 have multiple positives; H2 has two negatives supporting refutation; H3 has three negatives confirming low activation. \n- Gaps:\n  - H1: Test additional present perfect variants and the emphasized pattern \u201cnever, ever\u201d.\n  - H2: Add more outside-PP controls, especially standalone \u201cnever\u201d and non-PP interrogatives with \u201cever\u201d.\n  - H4: Further quantify interrogatives vs declaratives; current evidence suggests declaratives > interrogatives.\n- Contradictions: None between hypotheses; however, data contradicts the original claim that interrogatives > declaratives\u2014observed pattern is the reverse.\n\nDECISION:\nNeed more testing: YES\n- H1: \"She has never tried.\"\n- H1: \"I have never, ever tried.\"\n- H2: \"Never again please.\"\n- H2: \"Do you ever go?\"\n- H4: \"Has he ever been there?\"",

    "REVIEW SUMMARY:\n- H1: Confirmed. Feature targets ' ever'/' never' in perfect constructions; ' never' activates moderately-strongly (~3.0\u20133.7), ' ever' modestly (~0.7\u20132.25); outside perfect ' ever' \u22480.\n- H2: Refuted. Non\u2013present perfect uses of 'ever'/'never' consistently near zero (0.0000\u20130.1670; target tokens 0.0000\u20130.0537).\n- H3: Confirmed. Present perfect without ' ever'/' never' and substring forms ('Everyone', 'Forever') show near-zero activation (max 0.0527).\n- H4: Confirmed (template sensitivity). Interrogative perfect yields selective, modest activation on ' ever' (0.7500\u20131.5469); declarative ' never' stronger (~3.3750).\n\nASSESSMENT:\n- Adequately tested: Yes. H1 (8 tests), H2 (6 tests), H3 (4 tests), H4 (6 tests) provide consistent, convergent evidence.\n- Gaps: Minor only (e.g., wider variety of interrogative contexts, additional emphatic forms), not critical to core conclusions.\n- Contradictions: None. Results coherently indicate the feature focuses on present/perfect polarity/experiential adverbs, with higher response to ' never' than ' ever'.\n\nDECISION:\nNeed more testing: NO\nExplanation: Current evidence is sufficient for final conclusions\u2014multiple tests per hypothesis show consistent activation patterns: selective activation on ' ever'/' never' in perfect constructions (H1/H4), absence of lexical activation outside perfect (H2), and low baselines without these adverbs (H3).",
    "[DESCRIPTION]: \nFeature 15411 (Layer 7) detects English perfect-construction polarity/experiential adverbs, strongly preferring ' never' in declarative perfects and modestly activating on ' ever' in interrogative perfects. Across tests, ' never' in perfect contexts activates ~3.0469\u20133.7344, while ' ever' in interrogative perfects activates ~0.6953\u20132.2500; present perfect without these adverbs and non-perfect/idiomatic uses of 'ever/never' are near-zero (0.0000\u20130.1670). No evidence of lexical activation for 'ever/never' outside perfect constructions; substrings ('Everyone', 'Forever') do not activate.\n\n[EVIDENCE]:\n- Test 1: 'Have you ever tried sushi?' \u2192 activation 2.2500 on ' ever' (supports H1/H4)\n- Test 2: 'It was ever so quiet.' \u2192 max 0.1670 on 'It'; ' ever'=0.0000 (supports H2 refuted)\n- Test 3: 'I have seen it already.' \u2192 max 0.0527 (supports H3)\n- Test 4: 'Has she ever considered switching careers?' \u2192 ' ever'=0.7500 (supports H4)\n- Test 5: \"I've never been to Paris.\" \u2192 ' never'=3.2969 (supports H1)\n- Test 6: 'Have they ever visited Rome?' \u2192 ' ever'=1.3438 (supports H4)\n- Test 8: 'We have never met.' \u2192 ' never'=3.3750 (supports H1/H4 comparison)\n- Test 9: 'Have I ever told you?' \u2192 ' ever'=0.6953 (supports H4)\n- Test 10: 'Ever since we met.' \u2192 'Ever'=0.0537 (supports H2 refuted)\n- Test 11: 'Everyone was ready.' \u2192 0.0000 (supports H3 substring control)\n- Test 12: 'Forever is enough.' \u2192 0.0000 (supports H3 substring control)\n- Test 14: 'She has never tried.' \u2192 ' never'=3.0469 (supports H1)\n- Test 15: 'I have never, ever tried.' \u2192 ' never'=3.7344; ' ever'=0.0000 (supports H1; shows preference for ' never')\n- Test 17: 'Do you ever go?' \u2192 ' ever'=0.0000 (supports H2 refuted; non-perfect interrogative)\n- Test 18: 'Has he ever been there?' \u2192 ' ever'=1.5469 (supports H4)\n- Test 19: 'I had never seen it.' \u2192 ' never'=3.2969 (supports H1; past perfect)\n- Test 20: 'He has never once lied.' \u2192 ' never'=3.5469 (supports H1)\n- Test 22: 'It hardly ever rains.' \u2192 max 0.1670 on 'It'; ' ever'=0.0000 (supports H2 refuted)\n- Test 24: \"Haven't you ever tried?\" \u2192 ' ever'=1.5391 (supports H4; contraction robust)\n\n[LABEL 1]: English perfect-construction polarity/experiential adverbs: strong on ' never' (declarative perfect), modest on ' ever' (interrogative perfect); near-zero outside perfect or in substrings"
