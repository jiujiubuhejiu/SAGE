    "content": "OBSERVATION:\n- Pattern 1: The maximal-activation token is consistently the adverb “ever” or “never.” Examples: “ ever” at 9.438 (Exs 1–2), 9.250 (Exs 3–4), 8.125 (Ex 13), 8.062 (Ex 14); “ never” at 9.000 (Exs 5–6), 8.688 (Exs 7–8), 8.562 (Ex 9), 8.500 (Exs 10–11), 8.312 (Ex 12), 7.938 (Ex 15).\n- Pattern 2: “ever” appears predominantly in the interrogative present perfect frame “Have you ever …” (Exs 1–4, 13, 14). “never” appears predominantly in declarative present perfect frames “I have/I’ve never …” (Exs 5–6, 9–12, 15) and in emphasis “never, ever” (Exs 7–8).\n- Pattern 3: Present perfect structure proximity: “have/’ve” immediately precedes “ever/never” in most cases (e.g., “Have you ever …”, “I’ve never …”, “I have never …”).\n- Pattern 4: Activation magnitudes: “ever” in “Have you ever …” tops at 9.438–9.250; “never” in “I’ve/I have never …” is slightly lower on average (9.000–7.938), with “never, ever” at 8.688.\n- Common elements: English adverbs “ever/never”; present perfect auxiliaries (have/’ve); experiential/negation semantics; frequent pronouns I/you; punctuation/quotes do not prevent activation.\n\n[HYPOTHESIS LIST]:\nHypothesis_1: This feature detects the tokens “ ever” and “ never” as experiential/polarity adverbs, with strongest activation when they appear in present perfect constructions (e.g., “Have you ever …”, “I have/I’ve never …”). Predicted strong positives: “Have you ever tried sushi?” (high on “ ever”); “I’ve never been to Paris.” (high on “ never”).\n\nHypothesis_2: The detector is primarily lexical for the standalone tokens “ ever”/“ never” and will also activate outside present perfect (e.g., “ever since I moved…”, “It was ever so quiet”), but with slightly lower activation than the canonical “Have you ever …”/“I have never …” frames.\n\nHypothesis_3: Negative control: Present perfect sentences lacking “ever/never” (e.g., “I have seen it already.”, “She has finished.”) will show low activation on all tokens. Also words that contain the substring but are different tokens (e.g., “every”, “forever” if tokenized as a single token) will not strongly activate.\n\nHypothesis_4: The feature is sensitive to the “Have you ever …” interrogative template and yields higher activations for that pattern than for declarative “I’ve/I have never …” statements (consistent with ~9.4 vs ~9.0 maxima). Edge prediction: “Has she ever considered…?” > “We have never considered…” in activation on the “ ever/ never” token respectively."

Edge prediction: “Has she ever considered…?” > “We have never considered…” in activation on the “ ever/ never” token respectively.\nTest Design: Unknown\n\n\n**Test Result** (Complete execution output from get_activation_trace()):\n\n**Complete Test Execution Output**:\nOutput:\nTest prompt: 'Has she ever considered switching careers?'\nMax activation: 0.7500 (at token: ' ever')\nTokens/activations: [('<|im_end|>', '0.0000'), ('Has', '0.0000'), (' she', '0.0000'), (' ever', '0.7500'), (' considered', '0.0000'), (' switching', '0.0000'), (' careers', '0.0000'), ('?', '0.0000')]\n\n\n**Test Summary**:\n\n\n🚨 **MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT - 3 REQUIRED SECTIONS** 🚨\n\n**YOU MUST OUTPUT ALL 3 SECTIONS IN THIS EXACT ORDER:**\n\n**Section 1 - ANALYSIS:** (extract numbers from test output above)\n```\nANALYSIS:\nSummary activation: [copy max activation value from test output]\nBOS activation: [copy BOS value from test output]\nTop non-BOS tokens: [copy top 3 tokens with their values from test output]\n```\n\n**Section 2 - INTERPRETATION:** (explain what the numbers mean)\n```\nINTERPRETATION:\n[Does this result CONFIRM, REFUTE, or REFINE the hypothesis?]\n[Why? Compare actual activation to expected activation]\n[Cite specific token activations from test output]\n```\n\n**Section 3 - UPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:** (state the verdict)\n```\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: [CONFIRMED / REFUTED / REFINED / UNCHANGED]\n[MANDATORY - Provide evidence/reason/refined text based on status]\n```\n\n❌ **FORBIDDEN - DO NOT:**\n- Issue [TOOL] commands (you already have results)\n- Design new tests (wrong state)\n- Skip any of the 3 required sections\n- Make up activation values (use values from test output above)\n\n✅ **CORRECT EXAMPLE:**\n```\nANALYSIS:\nSummary activation: 13.8448\nBOS activation: 0.0000\nTop non-BOS tokens: '▁for'=13.8448, '▁it'=8.4380, '▁now'=4.0490\n\nINTERPRETATION:\nThis CONFIRMS the hypothesis. The test prompt \"That's it for now.\" produced high activation (13.8) on token '▁for', matching the expected pattern. This is consistent with corpus exemplars where '▁for' in closure contexts showed 15-17 activation.\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: CONFIRMED\nEvidence: Test shows '▁for'=13.8 in \"That's it for now\", consistent with corpus pattern of high '▁for' activation in closure phrases \"it for [X]\".\n```\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n1. Output ALL 3 sections (ANALYSIS + INTERPRETATION + UPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS)\n2. Extract REAL values from test output above (don't make up numbers)\n3. Compare to corpus exemplars when available\n4. Be honest: if test contradicts hypothesis, say REFUTED\n5. Do NOT issue [TOOL] commands in this state\n- Extract REAL activation values from the test output provided\n- Do NOT design new tests or issue [TOOL] commands\n- Do NOT generate TEST DESIGN sections\n- MUST analyze the ACTUAL test results shown above\n- Compare to previous tests quantitatively if available\n"

Identify ALL tokens with activation ≥10.0 from corpus exemplars (Round 2)\n2. Verify each token was tested in at least ONE synthetic test prompt\n3. If ALL tested → \"Can conclude: YES\"; If ANY untested → \"Can conclude: NO\" (list untested tokens)\n4. Exception: Round ≥15 → Can conclude despite gaps\n\n**Conclusion Assessment**:\n1. Can we draw conclusions now? (YES/NO)\n2. Do we have sufficient evidence? (≥3 tests, ≥10 rounds OR confirmed pattern)\n3. Corpus coverage: Have all high-activation tokens (≥10.0) been tested?\n4. Are there critical tests missing? (Be specific if NO)\n\n**Rules**:\n- Do NOT issue [TOOL] commands\n- **MANDATORY**: After 2+ test results, UNCHANGED is FORBIDDEN\n- **MANDATORY**: Prefer CONFIRMED/REFUTED when evidence is strong; Use REFINED when evidence is weak/ambiguous\n- **MANDATORY**: Check corpus coverage before concluding\n- Be honest about evidence sufficiency; don't wait for \"perfect\" consistency\n"

Corpus coverage: no ≥10.0 tokens in exemplars (max ~9.438), so that threshold is not applicable; critical missing tests include a matched declarative control (e.g., \"We have never considered...\") to assess the \"higher-than-declarative\" claim."

    "content": "REVIEW SUMMARY:\n- H1: Confirmed. Selective activation on ' ever'/' never' in present perfect; moderate magnitudes (e.g., ' ever'=2.2500; ' never'=3.2969).\n- H2: Refuted. No lexical activation outside present perfect; ' ever' in non-PP contexts near zero (0.0000–0.0537).\n- H3: Confirmed. Present perfect without ' ever'/' never' and substring forms ('Everyone', 'Forever') show near-zero activation.\n- H4: Confirmed (template sensitivity). Interrogative present perfect yields modest activation on ' ever' (0.7500; 1.3438). Comparative note: declarative ' never' is stronger (~3.3750) than interrogative ' ever' in our tests.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n- Adequacy: Mostly adequate. H1 and H4 have multiple positives; H2 has two negatives supporting refutation; H3 has three negatives confirming low activation. \n- Gaps:\n  - H1: Test additional present perfect variants and the emphasized pattern “never, ever”.\n  - H2: Add more outside-PP controls, especially standalone “never” and non-PP interrogatives with “ever”.\n  - H4: Further quantify interrogatives vs declaratives; current evidence suggests declaratives > interrogatives.\n- Contradictions: None between hypotheses; however, data contradicts the original claim that interrogatives > declaratives—observed pattern is the reverse.\n\nDECISION:\nNeed more testing: YES\n- H1: \"She has never tried.\"\n- H1: \"I have never, ever tried.\"\n- H2: \"Never again please.\"\n- H2: \"Do you ever go?\"\n- H4: \"Has he ever been there?\""

One test per line\n\n**Review Guidelines**:\n- Check if each hypothesis has sufficient test evidence (at least 2-3 tests)\n- Verify that CONFIRMED/REFUTED hypotheses have strong supporting evidence\n- Identify any hypotheses that may need refinement or additional testing\n- Consider if there are any high-activation corpus tokens that haven't been tested\n- Ensure no critical patterns are missing from the analysis\n- **Limit**: Suggest a maximum of 2-3 tests per hypothesis (focus on the most critical gaps)\n\n**Rules**:\n- Be thorough: review ALL hypotheses, not just the confirmed ones\n- Be honest: if evidence is insufficient, say so\n- Be specific: if more testing is needed, use the format above for suggested tests\n- Do NOT issue [TOOL] commands\n- Base assessment on REAL test data provided above\n- **Safety**: This is review iteration 3/3. After 3 iterations, proceed to final conclusion regardless.\n"

    "content": "REVIEW SUMMARY:\n- H1: Confirmed. Feature targets ' ever'/' never' in perfect constructions; ' never' activates moderately-strongly (~3.0–3.7), ' ever' modestly (~0.7–2.25); outside perfect ' ever' ≈0.\n- H2: Refuted. Non–present perfect uses of 'ever'/'never' consistently near zero (0.0000–0.1670; target tokens 0.0000–0.0537).\n- H3: Confirmed. Present perfect without ' ever'/' never' and substring forms ('Everyone', 'Forever') show near-zero activation (max 0.0527).\n- H4: Confirmed (template sensitivity). Interrogative perfect yields selective, modest activation on ' ever' (0.7500–1.5469); declarative ' never' stronger (~3.3750).\n\nASSESSMENT:\n- Adequately tested: Yes. H1 (8 tests), H2 (6 tests), H3 (4 tests), H4 (6 tests) provide consistent, convergent evidence.\n- Gaps: Minor only (e.g., wider variety of interrogative contexts, additional emphatic forms), not critical to core conclusions.\n- Contradictions: None. Results coherently indicate the feature focuses on present/perfect polarity/experiential adverbs, with higher response to ' never' than ' ever'.\n\nDECISION:\nNeed more testing: NO\nExplanation: Current evidence is sufficient for final conclusions—multiple tests per hypothesis show consistent activation patterns: selective activation on ' ever'/' never' in perfect constructions (H1/H4), absence of lexical activation outside perfect (H2), and low baselines without these adverbs (H3)."

Also words that contain the substring but are different tokens (e.g., “every”, “forever” if tokenized as a single token) will not strongly activate.\n✅ H4: The feature selectively activates on the token ' ever' in interrogative present perfect templates (e.g., \"Has/Have [pronoun] ever ...\"), but the activation magnitude is modest; the claim that interrogatives are higher than declarative 'never' cases remains unverified.\n\n\n**Required Output Format**:\n```\n[DESCRIPTION]: \n[2-3 sentences describing what this feature detects. \nMust be specific and complete. Include activation ranges and statistical evidence.]\n\n[EVIDENCE]:\n- Test X: [prompt] → activation [value] (supports [hypothesis])\n- Test Y: [prompt] → activation [value] (supports [hypothesis])\n[List all key evidence with specific activation values]\n\n[LABEL 1]: [Label based on hypothesis group - merge hypotheses describing the same feature]\n[LABEL 2]: [Only if there are hypotheses describing a DIFFERENT feature]\n\n```\n\n**Conclusion Guidelines**:\n- Base conclusion on REAL activation data from actual tests\n- Include specific activation values and statistical evidence\n- Be selective: very specific (e.g., \"Python function definitions with return statements\") not just \"code\"\n- Be complete: include all relevant aspects the feature is selective for\n- If feature is selective for multiple concepts, list them separated by logical \"OR\"\n- Must acknowledge any contradictory evidence\n\n**CRITICAL - Label Generation Based on Hypotheses**:\n- Labels MUST be strongly related to HYPOTHESES, not just corpus tokens\n- Review your HYPOTHESIS LIST: Which hypotheses describe the SAME feature/pattern?\n  * Hypotheses describing the SAME feature content → MERGE into ONE LABEL\n  * Hypotheses describing DIFFERENT features → SEPARATE LABELS\n- Label grouping logic:\n  * Step 1: Group hypotheses by semantic similarity (do they detect the same underlying pattern?)\n  * Step 2: For each group of related hypotheses, create ONE label that captures the common feature\n  * Step 3: Only create separate labels if hypotheses describe genuinely different features\n- Examples (use YOUR actual hypotheses, not these abstract ones):\n  * If H1=\"detects 'it' in closure 'That's it'\" and H3=\"detects 'for' in 'That's it for [X]'\"\n    → These are related (both about closure formulas) → Consider ONE label: \"Closure formulas ('That's it' and wrap-up segues)\"\n  * If H1=\"detects Python imports\" and H2=\"detects function definitions\"\n    → These are different features → TWO labels: [LABEL 1] for imports, [LABEL 2] for functions\n- Key principle: Labels should reflect the FEATURE being detected, not just individual tokens or patterns\n- Do not create labels for untested hypotheses (even if they were in the hypothesis list)\n- Do not create separate labels for every hypothesis - group related ones together\n\n**Quality Criteria**:\n- Description must cite specific activation values\n- Label must be precise (not \"code\" but \"Python imports\")\n- Labels should be based on HYPOTHESES: group related hypotheses into one label, separate different features\n- Each label should represent a distinct feature/pattern (not just individual tokens)\n- Must acknowledge any contradictory evidence\n- MUST be based on REAL test data, not assumptions\n\n**Rules**:\n- Do NOT issue [TOOL] commands\n- Base conclusion on provided evidence\n- Be scientific and evidence-based\n"
