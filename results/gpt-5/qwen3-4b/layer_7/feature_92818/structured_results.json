Predicted strong activation on tokens: \u201cis/was/are/were/\u2019s\u201d in \u201cthat he is\u2026,\u201d \u201cit was\u2026,\u201d \u201cthey are\u2026,\u201d \u201cshe\u2019s \u2026\u201d.\n\nHypothesis_2: The feature is sensitive to the contracted clitic \"'s\" regardless of whether it means \u201cis\u201d or \u201chas,\u201d with particularly strong activation on \"'s\" (e.g., \u201cshe\u2019s been\u2026,\u201d \u201che\u2019s happy\u201d). Prediction: high activation on \"'s\" in both \u201che\u2019s tall\u201d and \u201che\u2019s been waiting,\u201d potentially > corresponding uncontracted \u201cis/has\u201d.\n\nHypothesis_3: Negative control: Possessive \"'s\" (e.g., \u201cJohn\u2019s book\u201d) and non-\u201cbe/have\u201d linking verbs (e.g., \u201cseems,\u201d \u201cbecomes,\u201d \u201cappears\u201d) will not strongly activate this feature. Prediction: near-baseline activation on the \"'s\" in \u201cthe teacher\u2019s desk\u201d and on \u201cseems/becomes.\u201d\n\nHypothesis_4: Tense/number preference: The feature prefers present 3rd-singular (\u201cis,\u201d \u201c\u2019s\u201d) over past/plural forms (\u201cwas/were/are\u201d), mirroring observed magnitudes ('s 3.422 > is 3.250/2.656 > was 2.266/1.977/1.703 \u2248 were 1.820 > are 1.711).

The hypothesis predicted strong activation on finite \u201cbe\u201d in a that-clause after a pronoun. We observed a selective, non-zero peak on ' is'=0.4336 while all other tokens were 0.0000, indicating sensitivity to finite \u201cbe\u201d in this context but with much weaker magnitude than the corpus exemplars (e.g., ' is'\u22483.25).

Explanation: In \"John's book vanished.\", the possessive \"'s\" token activated at 0.0000 (max 0.0000 overall), matching the negative-control prediction.\n\nSTATUS ASSESSMENT:\nCurrent Status: REFINED\nReason: One test provides clear evidence for the possessive \"'s\" portion (target \"'s\"=0.0000), but we have not yet tested non\u2013be/have linking verbs, so we cannot fully confirm the broader hypothesis.
