    "content": "OBSERVATION:\n- Pattern 1: The max-activation token is consistently a finite form of the English auxiliary/copular “be” or contracted \"'s\": \"'s\" (3.422), \"is\" (3.250, 2.656), \"was\" (2.266, 1.977, 1.703), \"were\" (1.820), \"are\" (1.711).\n- Pattern 2: These forms typically follow pronouns (she/he/it/they) and often occur inside “that”-clauses: “that he is” (3.250/2.656), “that it was” (1.977), “that they are” (1.711).\n- Pattern 3: The top exemplar \"'s\" occurs in “she's been craving” where \"'s\" = has (present perfect), showing the feature fires on contracted \"'s\" even when it is “has,” not “is” (3.422).\n- Pattern 4: Complements after the be-form vary (adjective “red,” past participle “buried,” adjective “destined,” progressive “facing”), indicating the feature is not tied to a specific predicate type.\n- Common elements: Finite “be” morphology (is/was/are/were) and contracted \"'s\"; pronoun subjects (he/she/it/they); frequent “that + pronoun + be” subordinate clause context; stronger activations for present 3rd-singular forms ('s, is) than past/plural forms.\n\n[HYPOTHESIS LIST]:\nHypothesis_1: This feature detects finite forms of the English verb “to be” (is/was/are/were) and contracted \"'s\" functioning as auxiliaries/copulas, especially immediately following pronouns and within “that”-clauses. Predicted strong activation on tokens: “is/was/are/were/’s” in “that he is…,” “it was…,” “they are…,” “she’s …”.\n\nHypothesis_2: The feature is sensitive to the contracted clitic \"'s\" regardless of whether it means “is” or “has,” with particularly strong activation on \"'s\" (e.g., “she’s been…,” “he’s happy”). Prediction: high activation on \"'s\" in both “he’s tall” and “he’s been waiting,” potentially > corresponding uncontracted “is/has”.\n\nHypothesis_3: Negative control: Possessive \"'s\" (e.g., “John’s book”) and non-“be/have” linking verbs (e.g., “seems,” “becomes,” “appears”) will not strongly activate this feature. Prediction: near-baseline activation on the \"'s\" in “the teacher’s desk” and on “seems/becomes.”\n\nHypothesis_4: Tense/number preference: The feature prefers present 3rd-singular (“is,” “’s”) over past/plural forms (“was/were/are”), mirroring observed magnitudes ('s 3.422 > is 3.250/2.656 > was 2.266/1.977/1.703 ≈ were 1.820 > are 1.711). Prediction: “She is …” / “She’s …” > “He was …” ≈ “They were …” > “They are …” in activation strength."

Prediction: “She is …” / “She’s …” > “He was …” ≈ “They were …” > “They are …” in activation strength.\nTest Design: Unknown\n\n\n**Test Result** (Complete execution output from get_activation_trace()):\n\n**Complete Test Execution Output**:\nOutput:\nTest prompt: 'She is happy.'\nMax activation: 0.0000 (at token: '<|im_end|>')\nTokens/activations: [('<|im_end|>', '0.0000'), ('She', '0.0000'), (' is', '0.0000'), (' happy', '0.0000'), ('.', '0.0000')]\n\n\n**Test Summary**:\n\n\n🚨 **MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT - 3 REQUIRED SECTIONS** 🚨\n\n**YOU MUST OUTPUT ALL 3 SECTIONS IN THIS EXACT ORDER:**\n\n**Section 1 - ANALYSIS:** (extract numbers from test output above)\n```\nANALYSIS:\nSummary activation: [copy max activation value from test output]\nBOS activation: [copy BOS value from test output]\nTop non-BOS tokens: [copy top 3 tokens with their values from test output]\n```\n\n**Section 2 - INTERPRETATION:** (explain what the numbers mean)\n```\nINTERPRETATION:\n[Does this result CONFIRM, REFUTE, or REFINE the hypothesis?]\n[Why?

The test prompt \"That's it for now.\" produced high activation (13.8) on token '▁for', matching the expected pattern. This is consistent with corpus exemplars where '▁for' in closure contexts showed 15-17 activation.\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: CONFIRMED\nEvidence: Test shows '▁for'=13.8 in \"That's it for now\", consistent with corpus pattern of high '▁for' activation in closure phrases \"it for [X]\".\n```\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n1.

Explanation: In “I think that he is ready.” the token ' is' reached 0.4336 while all other tokens were 0.0000, indicating sensitivity to finite “be” in the predicted configuration but much weaker than corpus exemplars (e.g., ' is'≈3.25).\n\nSTATUS ASSESSMENT:\nCurrent Status: REFINED\nReason: The single test produced a selective non-zero peak on the predicted token (' is'=0.4336) consistent with H1’s target, but activation was far below corpus magnitudes, suggesting strong context dependence rather than uniformly high responses. Corpus coverage check: no ≥10.0-activation tokens exist in exemplars, so no high-activation gaps; however, with only 1 test, evidence is insufficient to confirm or refute, warranting refinement."

Are there critical tests missing? (Be specific if NO)\n\n**Rules**:\n- Do NOT issue [TOOL] commands\n- **MANDATORY**: After 2+ test results, UNCHANGED is FORBIDDEN\n- **MANDATORY**: Prefer CONFIRMED/REFUTED when evidence is strong; Use REFINED when evidence is weak/ambiguous\n- **MANDATORY**: Check corpus coverage before concluding\n- Be honest about evidence sufficiency; don't wait for \"perfect\" consistency\n"

    "content": "HYPOTHESIS UPDATES:\n- H4 (REFINED): Refined version: The feature does not show an inherent preference for present 3rd-singular “is/’s” in simple main clauses; any elevated activation for be-forms appears context-dependent (e.g., embedded that-clauses with pronoun subjects). Tense/number preference (is > was/were/are) remains unproven and should only be claimed within the specific high-activation frames seen in corpus exemplars. Explanation: In “She is happy.” the token ' is' activated at 0.0000, contradicting the predicted strong preference for present 3rd-singular in a bare copular clause.\n\nSTATUS ASSESSMENT:\nCurrent Status: REFINED\nReason: The only test for H4 (“She is happy.”) yielded 0.0000 on ' is', directly opposing the expected higher activation for present 3rd-singular “is.” With one test, evidence is insufficient to fully refute a context-qualified preference, so we refine the hypothesis to restrict any preference to specific frames (e.g., that-clauses). Corpus coverage: No ≥10.0 tokens in exemplars; critical missing tests include matched that-clause sentences comparing “is/’s” vs “was/were/are” to evaluate preference within the high-activation context suggested by the corpus."

Predicted strong activation on tokens: “is/was/are/were/’s” in “that he is…,” “it was…,” “they are…,” “she’s …”.\n  Current Text: This feature detects finite forms of “be” (e.g., is/was/are/were) with context dependence, showing selective activation on the “be” token in that-clause frames after pronouns, but the magnitude is modest in short/minimal contexts and appears stronger in richer/narrative contexts.

Prediction: high activation on \"'s\" in both “he’s tall” and “he’s been waiting,” potentially > corresponding uncontracted “is/has”.\n  Current Text: The feature does not generally spike on contracted \\''s (is/has). Any sensitivity to \\''s appears highly context-dependent, likely requiring richer clause structure (e.g., complementizer “that” + pronoun + \\''s + predicate) similar to corpus exemplars rather than short standalone sentences. Explanation: In \"She\\'s been waiting.\", the target token \"'s\" registered 0.0000 activation (max 0.0000 overall), contradicting the predicted strong response.\n  Status: CONFIRMED\n  Tests: 2 tests\n  Test History:\n    1.

Prediction: near-baseline activation on the \"'s\" in “the teacher’s desk” and on “seems/becomes.”\n  Current Text: Possessive \"'s\" does not activate this feature (near-baseline), while the claim about non–be/have linking verbs (e.g., \"seems,\" \"becomes,\" \"appears\") remains untested but is predicted to be near-baseline as well. Explanation: In \"John's book vanished.\", the possessive \"'s\" token activated at 0.0000 (max 0.0000 overall), matching the negative-control prediction.\n  Status: CONFIRMED\n  Tests: 2 tests\n  Test History:\n    1.

Prediction: “She is …” / “She’s …” > “He was …” ≈ “They were …” > “They are …” in activation strength.\n  Current Text: The feature does not show an inherent preference for present 3rd-singular “is/’s” in simple main clauses; any elevated activation for be-forms appears context-dependent (e.g., embedded that-clauses with pronoun subjects). Tense/number preference (is > was/were/are) remains unproven and should only be claimed within the specific high-activation frames seen in corpus exemplars.

There is context variability: “that it is …” yielded 0.0000, and ’s sensitivity depends on rich clause context; overall test activation range: 0.0000–1.3906.\n\n[EVIDENCE]:\n- Test 1: \"I think that he is ready.\" → ' is'=0.4336 (supports H1: be in that-clause)\n- Test 5: \"It is claimed that he is buried.\" → second ' is'=1.3047; main-clause ' is'=0.0000 (supports H1: context dependence; main clause off)\n- Test 9: \"They said that it was unfair.\" → ' was'=0.7891 (supports H1: past form in that-clause)\n- Test 10: \"She thought that they were late.\" → ' were'=0.9102 (supports H1: plural past in that-clause)\n- Test 14: \"They think that they are ready.\" → ' are'=0.1426 (supports H1: weaker but >0 in that-clause)\n- Test 19: \"She said that they are here.\" → ' are'=0.5625 (supports H1: replication for are)\n- Test 6: \"We guessed that she's been waiting.\" → \"'s\"=1.3906 (supports H2: ’s activates in rich that-clause)\n- Test 20: \"We think that she's tall.\" → \"'s\"=0.7969 (supports H2: ’s as “is” in that-clause)\n- Test 16: \"They think that she's happy.\" → \"'s\"=0.5547 (supports H2: ’s as “is” in that-clause)\n- Test 21: \"They said that she's gone.\" → \"'s\"=0.2695 (supports H2: ’s as “has” in that-clause)\n- Test 2: \"She's been waiting.\" → \"'s\"=0.0000 (supports H2: minimal clause does not activate)\n- Test 3: \"John's book vanished.\" → possessive \"'s\"=0.0000 (supports H3: possessive off)\n- Test 7: \"She seems happy.\" → ' seems'=0.0000 (supports H3: non–be/have linker off)\n- Test 22: \"He appears tired.\" → ' appears'=0.0000 (supports H3: non–be/have linker off)\n- Test 4: \"She is happy.\" → ' is'=0.0000 (supports H4: main-clause be off)\n- Test 8: \"They are ready.\" → ' are'=0.0000 (supports H4: main-clause be off)\n- Test 13: \"He was late.\" → ' was'=0.0000 (supports H4: main-clause be off)\n- Test 15: \"They said that it is broken.\" → ' is'=0.0000 (contradiction/edge: “that it is …” zero)\n- Test 18: \"They think that it is true.\" → ' is'=0.0000 (contradiction/edge: “that it is …” zero)\n- Test 11: \"We think that he\\'s happy.\" → split \"'s\" tokens 0.0220 (tokenization artifact; weak support for H2)\n- Test 12: \"They said that he\\'s arrived.\" → split \"'s\" tokens 0.0000 (tokenization artifact; neutral)\n\n[LABEL 1]: Embedded that-clause finite BE/’s detector (… that [pronoun] is/was/were/are or ’s …), with main-clause/possessive/linker suppression and context-dependent magnitude"
