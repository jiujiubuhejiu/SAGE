    "content": "OBSERVATION:\n- Pattern 1: The max-activation token is overwhelmingly the morpheme “hat” or its close variants:\n  - ' hat' = 5.219 (Items 1–3), 4.938 (Items 5–6), 4.906 (Item 8), 4.844 (Item 9), 4.562 (Items 12–14), 4.469 (Item 15)\n  - ' hats' = 5.062 (Item 4)\n  - ' ats' subword within capitalized “Hat…” words = 4.938 (Item 7; “Hatsuzumi” tokenized as 'H' + 'ats' + ...)\n- Pattern 2: Semantic contexts consistently involve headgear:\n  - Direct references: “hat they were wearing,” “There are hats, caps and headbands,” “wearing a hat,” “The hat worn by the man,” “hat trick” (idiom still fires on 'hat')\n- Pattern 3: Tokenization-driven sensitivity:\n  - Activation aligns to BPE units corresponding to “hat” even when split (e.g., 'H' + 'ats' → still high at 'ats' = 4.938)\n- Pattern 4: Outlier/possible spurious activation on 'et':\n  - ' et' in “picket” (tokenized ' pick' + 'et') shows 4.625 (Items 10–11) despite no headgear semantics\n- Common elements: Tokens ' hat'/' hats'/' ats' (within “Hat…”); contexts of wearing/describing hats; high sparsity (only those tokens have nonzero activations); one notable non-hat fragment 'et' at 4.625 as a likely false positive\n\n[HYPOTHESIS LIST]:\nHypothesis_1: The feature is a lexical detector for the morpheme “hat,” firing strongly on the tokens ' hat', ' hats', and on 'ats' when it follows an initial 'H' in capitalized “Hat…” words (e.g., “Hatsune,” “Hatsuzumi”). Expect activations ≥4.5 on these subwords; peak around ~5.2 on ' hat'.\n\nHypothesis_2: Beyond pure lexeme matching, the feature corresponds to the semantic concept of hats/headgear and will sometimes (weaker) activate on related headgear terms that share subword fragments with “hat” or common BPE pieces seen in headgear (e.g., 'et' in “beret”). Predict moderate activation (≈3–4.5) on words like “beret,” while “cap,” “beanie,” “headband” alone will show low activation unless “hat” also appears.\n\nHypothesis_3: Negative control (edge case): Words containing the character sequence “hat” but not yielding a ' hat'/'hats'/'ats' BPE unit (e.g., “what,” “that,” “chatter,” “Hathaway”) will not activate or will activate very weakly (<1), because the tokenizer represents these as different subword units (e.g., ' what', ' that') that do not match the learned “hat” subtoken.\n\nHypothesis_4: The feature has a secondary, spurious sensitivity to the BPE fragment 'et' irrespective of hat semantics, producing occasional false positives on words ending with “-et” (e.g., “picket,” possibly “cricket,” “market”). Predict measurable activation (≈3–4.7) on isolated 'et' in such tokenizations even without any headgear context."

    "content": "HYPOTHESIS UPDATES:\n- H1 (STATUS): REFINED\n  Refined version: The feature is primarily a lexical detector for the morpheme “hat,” activating on tokens aligned to ' hat', ' hats', and the subword 'ats' in capitalized “Hat…” words, with context-dependent magnitude (~3.0–5.3). Minimal contexts produce moderate activation (~3.4), while richer descriptive contexts can reach ~5.2.\n  Explanation: The test \"He wore a hat.\" produced ' hat'=3.4062 (others 0.0000), showing clear lexical selectivity but lower magnitude than the original ≥4.5 expectation; corpus exemplars show higher peaks on ' hat'=5.219 and ' hats'=5.062 and 'ats'≈4.938.\n\nSTATUS ASSESSMENT:\nCurrent Status: REFINED\nReason: The single positive test confirms lexical targeting of ' hat' but with weaker-than-expected strength (3.4062 vs. predicted ≥4.5), indicating context modulation. Corpus coverage check: exemplars have no ≥10.0 tokens, so coverage constraints are satisfied; however, plural ' hats' and capitalized 'ats' cases remain untested synthetically, preventing a CONFIRMED status at this stage."

No activation on related headgear term “beret” (0.0000), contradicting semantic-generalization beyond “hat”.\n- H3: CONFIRMED. Negative control “that” shows 0.0000 activation, supporting BPE-specificity (non-' hat'/'hats'/'ats' do not fire).\n- H4: CONFIRMED. Spurious activation on 'et' in “picket” (4.5938) without hat semantics, consistent with corpus 'et' in “picket”.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n- Adequacy: H1 has 2 consistent positives but lacks a test for the 'ats' subword in capitalized “Hat…” words. H2 has 1 decisive negative consistent with refutation. H3 has 1 strong negative; broader coverage across multiple “hat”-containing words would strengthen generality. H4 has 1 positive; breadth across other “-et” words would firm up the “occasional” pattern.\n- Gaps: Untested 'ats' case for H1; additional negative controls for H3 (e.g., “what,” “Hathaway”); additional “-et” words for H4 (e.g., “cricket,” “bucket”) to characterize spuriousness.\n- Contradictions: None. H4’s “occasional” spurious 'et' is compatible with H2’s null on “beret.”\n\nDECISION:\nNeed more testing: YES\n- H1: \"I love Hatsune.\"\n- H1: \"Hatsuzumi arrived today.\"\n- H3: \"What happened today?\"\n- H3: \"Hathaway arrived late.\"\n- H4: \"We played cricket.\"\n- H4: \"They carried a bucket.\""
