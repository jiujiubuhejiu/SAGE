Expect activations \u22654.5 on these subwords; peak around ~5.2 on ' hat'.\n\nHypothesis_2: Beyond pure lexeme matching, the feature corresponds to the semantic concept of hats/headgear and will sometimes (weaker) activate on related headgear terms that share subword fragments with \u201chat\u201d or common BPE pieces seen in headgear (e.g., 'et' in \u201cberet\u201d).

The feature does lexically target ' hat' (max token = ' hat' with 3.4062), but the magnitude is lower than the expected \u22654.5 from the hypothesis. In this minimal context (\"He wore a hat.\"), only ' hat' activates (3.4062) while all other tokens are 0.0000, indicating lexical sensitivity but weaker-than-predicted strength.\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: REFINED\nEvidence: The feature reliably fires on the lexical token ' hat' but with moderate activation (~3.4 in a simple sentence), suggesting context modulates strength. Refined hypothesis: It detects ' hat'/'hats' (and likely 'ats' in capitalized \u201cHat\u2026\u201d words) with activation that can range from ~3 to ~5+, with stronger contexts producing higher peaks.",

The hypothesis predicted a spurious activation on the BPE fragment 'et' without hat semantics, with magnitude in the ~3\u20134.7 range. The prompt \"They formed a picket outside.\" shows 'et'=4.5938 (max), while all other tokens are 0.0000, matching the expected pattern.\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: CONFIRMED\nEvidence: Strong, isolated activation on 'et' (4.5938) in \"picket\" with no headgear context supports spurious sensitivity to the 'et' subtoken.",

Minimal contexts produce moderate activation (~3.4), while richer descriptive contexts can reach ~5.2.\n  Explanation: The test \"He wore a hat.\" produced ' hat'=3.4062 (others 0.0000), showing clear lexical selectivity but lower magnitude than the original \u22654.5 expectation; corpus exemplars show higher peaks on ' hat'=5.219 and ' hats'=5.062 and 'ats'\u22484.938.\n\nSTATUS ASSESSMENT:\nCurrent Status: REFINED\nReason: The single positive test confirms lexical targeting of ' hat' but with weaker-than-expected strength (3.4062 vs. predicted \u22654.5), indicating context modulation. Corpus coverage check: exemplars have no \u226510.0 tokens, so coverage constraints are satisfied; however, plural ' hats' and capitalized 'ats' cases remain untested synthetically, preventing a CONFIRMED status at this stage.",

The feature fires on the lexical token ' hats' with 3.5781 while all other tokens are 0.0000, matching the refined hypothesis that it detects 'hat' morphemes with context-dependent magnitude in the ~3.0\u20135.3 range. This aligns with the prior test (' hat'=3.4062) showing similar moderate activation in minimal context.\n\nUPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATUS:\nHypothesis: CONFIRMED\nEvidence: Two tests show consistent, selective activation on ' hat'=3.4062 and ' hats'=3.5781 with zero elsewhere, within the predicted 3.0\u20135.3 range for minimal contexts.",

Corpus coverage check: no \u226510.0 tokens in exemplars; Can conclude: YES.
